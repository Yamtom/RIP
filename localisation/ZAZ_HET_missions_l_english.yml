# ZAPORIZHIA & HETMANATE MISSIONS
# ========================================

 zaz_evolve_to_hetmanate_title:0 "Elevate the Sich to a Hetmanate"
 zaz_evolve_to_hetmanate_desc:0 "The Zaporizhian Sich can transform from a raiding host into a settled Hetmanate, assuming formal structures of governance and broader obligations."
 kru_confederation_balance:0 "Balance between Rada and Hetman"
 desc_kru_confederation_balance:0 "The Sich Rada still gathers to guard Cossack privileges, yet the hetman's bulava now commands lasting authority. Republican custom tempers the crown, legitimacy steadies the realm, and absolutist pretensions are kept in check."
 rip_jewish_invite_title:0 "Invite Jewish Merchants"
 rip_jewish_invite_desc:0 "Communities of Jewish merchants and financiers seek safe haven under our protection. Granting charters could invigorate trade and supply much-needed credit, but risks backlash from conservative clergy and guilds."
 rip_jewish_invite_accept:0 "Guarantee their charters and safety"
 rip_jewish_invite_restrict:0 "Restrict their activity"

# === EARLY MISSIONS (1444-1648) ===

# ZAZ_establish_sich
 ZAZ_establish_sich_title:0 "Establish the Sich"
 ZAZ_establish_sich_desc:0 "The Zaporozhian Sich must serve as more than just a military camp - it shall be the beating heart of free Cossackdom, a fortress beyond the reach of Polish magnates and Tatar raiders. Here, on the islands below the Dnipro rapids, we shall build a society governed by the Sich Rada, where every Cossack has a voice and the Kosh Otaman rules with the consent of his brothers-in-arms."
 
# ZAZ_chaiky_raids
 ZAZ_chaiky_raids_title:0 "The Chaiky Fleet"
 ZAZ_chaiky_raids_desc:0 "The chaiky - our swift river boats - strike terror into the hearts of Ottoman admirals and Crimean slave traders. These nimble craft, carrying forty Cossacks each, can navigate shallow waters and strike where great galleys cannot reach. Let us build a fleet of chaiky and launch raids against Kaffa, Constantinople itself, and the Crimean coast. The Black Sea shall know that free men will not tolerate the slave trade!"
 
# ZAZ_rally_hordes
 ZAZ_rally_hordes_title:0 "Masters of Steppe Warfare"
 ZAZ_rally_hordes_desc:0 "Living on the edge of the Great Steppe, we have learned the tactics of our nomadic neighbors. Our cavalry combines the discipline of European cavalry with the mobility and horse archery of the steppes. We must recruit from the villages along the frontier - men who know both the saddle and the saber, who can raid deep into enemy territory and vanish before reinforcements arrive."
 
# ZAZ_orthodox_protectors
 ZAZ_orthodox_protectors_title:0 "Defenders of Orthodoxy"
 ZAZ_orthodox_protectors_desc:0 "While Polish magnates impose Catholic Union upon our people, the Zaporozhian Host remains the last bastion of Orthodox faith and Ruthenian identity. The monks of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy look to us for protection. The brotherhoods of Lviv and Kyiv send their sons to join our ranks. We are not merely warriors - we are the sword and shield of the Orthodox faith in these lands."
 
# ZAZ_independce
 ZAZ_independce_title:0 "The Path to Freedom"
 ZAZ_independce_desc:0 "For too long we have served as border guards for foreign masters - Lithuania, Poland, Muscovy. Our hetmans are chosen by Polish kings, our numbers limited by the register. But the flame of freedom burns in every Cossack's heart. The time approaches when we must choose: remain as hired swords, or seize our destiny as a free nation!"
 
# ZAZ_lit
 ZAZ_lit_title:0 "Break the Polish Yoke"
 ZAZ_lit_desc:0 "The Commonwealth of Two Nations has long sought to reduce our privileges and Catholic-ize our people. The magnates treat the steppe as their private domain, imposing serfdom on free Cossacks. We have endured insults to our faith, restrictions on our numbers, and the execution of our leaders. No more! The hetman's mace shall no longer bow to the Polish crown!"
 
# ZAZ_finally
 ZAZ_finally_title:0 "The Zaporozhian State"
 ZAZ_finally_desc:0 "Through blood and sacrifice, we have secured our independence. The Sich Rada now governs a true Cossack state, where every warrior has equal voice in our assembly. Our hetman is chosen by our own will, not appointed by foreign kings. Yet independence brings new challenges - we must choose our path carefully, for great powers circle like wolves: Moscow offers protection, the Ottomans offer trade, the Poles seek revenge, and the Tatars raid our borders. The game of thrones has begun."

# === ALLIANCE PATH MISSIONS ===

# Turkish Alliance Path
 ZAZ_ally_tur_title:0 "Ottoman Alliance"
 ZAZ_ally_tur_desc:0 "The Sultan's power stretches from Vienna to the Persian Gulf. An alliance with the Sublime Porte offers protection from Polish revenge and Russian expansion, access to Black Sea trade, and military support against the Crimean Khan. But such an alliance comes with a price - we may be drawn into wars far from our homeland, and Orthodox brotherhoods will question our faith."
 
 ZAZ_TUR_contest_crimea_title:0 "Contest Crimean Dominance"
 ZAZ_TUR_contest_crimea_desc:0 "The Crimean Khanate has long been the Ottomans' loyal vassal and our greatest enemy. Their slave raids have devastated the Ukrainian lands for centuries. With Ottoman backing, we can challenge Crimean power directly, liberating captives and securing the steppe routes. The Sultan will reward those who humble his overly proud vassals."
 
 ZAZ_TUR_slave_trade_title:0 "Disrupt the Slave Trade"
 ZAZ_TUR_slave_trade_desc:0 "Kaffa, the great Genoese colony now under Ottoman rule, is the center of the Black Sea slave trade. Thousands of Ruthenians, Poles, and Muscovites are sold through its markets annually. As allies of the Sultan, we can pressure the Sublime Porte to restrict this trade, or at minimum, ensure our own people are exempt from bondage. Every freed slave is a potential Cossack recruit."

# Russian Alliance Path
 ZAZ_ally_rus_title:0 "The Muscovite Protectorate"
 ZAZ_ally_rus_desc:0 "Moscow claims to be the Third Rome, heir to Byzantine glory and protector of all Orthodox peoples. The Tsar offers us protection from Polish aggression, recognition of our autonomy, and support in our wars. But Muscovite protection comes with strings - they see us as 'Little Russians' to be absorbed, not as equals. We must navigate carefully between protection and subjugation."
 
 ZAZ_RUS_brack_lit_title:0 "Reconquer the Ruthenian Lands"
 ZAZ_RUS_brack_lit_desc:0 "With Russian backing, we can liberate all Ruthenian lands from Polish-Lithuanian rule. Kyiv, Chernihiv, Smolensk - these ancient cities of Rus' shall be freed from Catholic domination. The Tsar provides artillery and money; we provide the warriors who know the land. Together, we shall restore the unity of the Orthodox East."
 
 ZAZ_RUS_settle_south_title:0 "Colonize New Russia"
 ZAZ_RUS_settle_south_desc:0 "The vast steppe between the Dnipro and the Don Rivers lies empty, vulnerable to Tatar raids. Russian bureaucrats call it 'Novorossiya' - New Russia. We shall settle this land with Cossack stanitsas and slobodas, creating a buffer against the Crimean threat while preserving our way of life on the frontier."

# Polish Alliance Path
 ZAZ_ally_pol_title:0 "Return to the Commonwealth"
 ZAZ_ally_pol_desc:0 "The Commonwealth, for all its faults, offers something neither Moscow nor Istanbul can - republican liberty under law. The Polish-Lithuanian system of elected monarchy and noble democracy resonates with our Cossack tradition of elected hetmans. If we can secure recognition of our rights and Orthodox faith, the Commonwealth may yet be reformed into a true union of three nations: Poles, Lithuanians, and Ruthenians."
 
 ZAZ_POL_politics_title:0 "Seats in the Sejm"
 ZAZ_POL_politics_desc:0 "The Polish Sejm must include Cossack representatives with full voting rights. Our hetman should sit as a senator, equal to Polish palatines. Cossack officers should receive noble titles and the right to own land. If the Commonwealth treats us as partners rather than servants, we can build a powerful federation spanning from the Baltic to the Black Sea."

# Tatar Alliance Path
 ZAZ_ally_tartar_title:0 "Alliance of Steppe Peoples"
 ZAZ_ally_tartar_desc:0 "We Cossacks and the steppe nomads share more than our enemies realize - both live by the sword, both value freedom above all, both are warriors shaped by the harsh steppe. An alliance with the Golden Horde's successors offers us allies against both Polish and Russian expansion. Together, the mounted warriors of the steppe shall be invincible."
 
 ZAZ_GOL_politics_title:0 "The Steppe Confederation"
 ZAZ_GOL_politics_desc:0 "The various Tatar khanates - Crimea, Kazan, Astrakhan - are divided and weak. But united under strong leadership, with Cossack infantry supporting nomad cavalry, we could create a steppe empire rivaling the Mongol hordes of old. The settled lands tremble when the horse peoples unite!"

# Independent Path
 ZAZ_only_zaz_title:0 "The Cossack Republic"
 ZAZ_only_zaz_desc:0 "We reject all foreign masters! Neither Polish lords, Russian tsars, Ottoman sultans, nor Tatar khans shall dictate our destiny. The Zaporozhian Host shall remain free, governed by the Sich Rada, choosing our own hetmans, making our own laws. We shall be the Switzerland of Eastern Europe - small, but fiercely independent, our liberty guaranteed by our military prowess. Let the great powers learn: free Cossacks bow to no one!"
 
 ZAZ_UKR_politics_title:0 "Cossack Democracy"
 ZAZ_UKR_politics_desc:0 "The Sich Rada is the purest form of military democracy - every Cossack votes on major decisions, officers are elected, and even the Kosh Otaman can be deposed if he loses the Host's confidence. We shall extend this system across all our lands, creating a republic where merit, not birth, determines status. This Cossack democracy shall be our greatest strength."

# === EXPANSION MISSIONS ===

# ZAZ_krakow
 ZAZ_krakow_title:0 "Raid on Kraków"
 ZAZ_krakow_desc:0 "The old Polish capital, seat of the Jagiellonian dynasty, has grown fat on the tribute wrung from our people. Let our cavalry thunder through Małopolska, reminding Polish magnates that Cossack revenge is swift and terrible. Whether we conquer or merely raid, the Poles shall learn to fear the steppe warriors they once commanded."
 
# ZAZ_moskva  
 ZAZ_moskva_title:0 "Strike at the Third Rome"
 ZAZ_moskva_desc:0 "Moscow claims to rule all Rus' and protect all Orthodox peoples. But their 'protection' is merely another form of imperialism. If the Tsar will not grant us true autonomy, we shall demonstrate that the 'gathering of Russian lands' can work in reverse. Our mounted columns can reach the Kremlin's walls - let that be our diplomatic message!"

# === SETTLEMENT MISSIONS ===

# ZAZ_settlements
 ZAZ_settlements_title:0 "The Sloboda System"
 ZAZ_settlements_desc:0 "Between the fortress-cities and the open steppe, we shall establish slobodas - free settlements where peasants escaping serfdom can farm in relative safety. These military colonies will be defended by Cossack patrols, governed by elected starshynas, and exempt from feudal obligations. Each sloboda strengthens our demographic base and extends our control over the wilderness."

# ZAZ_istanbul
 ZAZ_istanbul_title:0 "The Constantinople Raid"
 ZAZ_istanbul_desc:0 "In 1615, our grandfathers raided the suburbs of Constantinople itself, burning Ottoman ships and plundering the Golden Horn. The Sultan's court panicked - could such barbarians truly strike at the heart of the empire? Let us recreate that legendary feat! A raid on Istanbul will echo through history and remind the world that Zaporozhian Cossacks fear no power on earth."

# === HETMANATE SPECIFIC MISSIONS ===

# HET_establish_capital
 HET_establish_capital_title:0 "The Hetman's Capital"
 HET_establish_capital_desc:0 "The Hetmanate needs a proper capital - not a nomadic camp, but a city worthy of a sovereign state. Whether we choose Kyiv, ancient mother of Rus', or Chyhyryn on the Dnipro, or another city, we must establish governmental institutions: the general military chancellery, the courts, the treasury, and the hetman's residence. Here foreign ambassadors will present their credentials to a legitimate government."

# HET_starshyna_system
 HET_starshyna_system_title:0 "The Starshyna Elite"
 HET_starshyna_system_desc:0 "The colonels, generals, and judges who form the Hetmanate's administrative class - the starshyna - are becoming a new nobility. These officers combine military command with civilian governance, holding vast estates while maintaining Cossack military traditions. We must formalize this system, granting land to loyal officers while ensuring they remain answerable to the Sich Rada."

# HET_kyiv_academy
 HET_kyiv_academy_title:0 "The Kyiv-Mohyla Academy"
 HET_kyiv_academy_desc:0 "The Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, founded by Metropolitan Petro Mohyla, is the Harvard of Eastern Europe - training theologians, philosophers, and statesmen. Under our protection, the Academy flourishes, producing scholars who defend Orthodox theology while embracing Western learning. This institution proves that Cossack swords and scholarly quills are equally sharp."

# HET_printing_press
 HET_printing_press_title:0 "The Printing Press"
 HET_printing_press_desc:0 "The printing press is mightier than the sword - it can shape minds across generations. We must establish printing houses in Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Lviv, publishing church books, chronicles, and legal codes in Church Slavonic and vernacular Ruthenian. Each printed page strengthens our cultural identity and resistance to foreign assimilation."

# HET_black_sea_trade
 HET_black_sea_trade_title:0 "Black Sea Commerce"
 HET_black_sea_trade_desc:0 "The rich black earth of Ukraine produces grain in abundance. By controlling the trade routes to the Black Sea, we can export wheat through Ottoman and Genoese ports, enriching our treasury. Cossack merchants shall compete with Polish factors, Greek traders, and Armenian dealers, proving that warriors can also be shrewd businessmen."

# === LATE GAME / CRISIS MISSIONS ===

# HET_mazepa_reform
 HET_mazepa_reform_title:0 "Mazepa's Renaissance"
 HET_mazepa_reform_desc:0 "Under Hetman Ivan Mazepa's enlightened rule, the Hetmanate experiences a cultural golden age. New churches rise in Cossack Baroque style, the Academy attracts scholars from across Europe, and the hetman's court rivals that of Warsaw or Moscow in splendor. Yet this Renaissance comes at a cost - the starshyna aristocracy grows powerful, and Russian officials watch suspiciously. Can we maintain our autonomy while achieving civilization?"

# HET_swedish_alliance
 HET_swedish_alliance_title:0 "The Swedish Gambit"
 HET_swedish_alliance_desc:0 "The Great Northern War offers a once-in-a-century opportunity. Charles XII of Sweden, the 'Lion of the North,' promises to restore full Cossack independence if we join him against Tsar Peter. It is a desperate gamble - if Sweden wins, we are free; if Russia wins, we are doomed. Hetman Mazepa has made his choice. Will you stand with him?"

# HET_poltava_choice
 HET_poltava_choice_title:0 "The Battle of Poltava"
 HET_poltava_choice_desc:0 "The armies meet near Poltava in the summer of 1709. The Russian artillery roars, Swedish cavalry charges, and the fate of nations hangs in the balance. If the Swedes win, the Hetmanate achieves true independence and Peter's empire crumbles. If Russia wins, Cossack autonomy is finished forever. There is no middle ground - only total victory or utter defeat."

# HET_russian_repression
 HET_russian_repression_title:0 "After Poltava"
 HET_russian_repression_desc:0 "The destruction of the Chortomlyk Sich. The execution of Kochubei and Iskra. The imposition of Russian residents. Peter's victory has brought terrible vengeance. Our privileges are stripped away, our leaders watched by informers, our autonomy dying by degrees. We must endure and preserve what we can, waiting for the next opportunity. The spirit of Cossack freedom cannot be killed - only forced underground."

# HET_final_hetman
 HET_final_hetman_title:0 "Rozumovsky - Last of the Hetmans"
 HET_final_hetman_desc:0 "Kyrylo Rozumovsky, Catherine's favorite, is the last hetman. Educated, cultured, more courtier than warrior, he represents the final evolution of the office - or its degradation. In 1764, Catherine abolishes the hetmanate entirely. The free-elect hetman becomes a Russian governor. The Cossack nation becomes a province. After three centuries of struggle, the light of Ukrainian autonomy is extinguished."

# HET_sich_destruction
 HET_sich_destruction_title:0 "Destruction of the Sich - 1775"
 HET_sich_destruction_desc:0 "Russian artillery bombards the Sich. Regiments of the line storm the palisades. The last Kosh Otaman, Petro Kalnyshevsky, is captured and imprisoned in the frozen hell of Solovki monastery. The Zaporozhian Host is officially dissolved. The free lands are renamed 'Novorossiya' - New Russia - and granted to Russian colonists and German settlers. The Cossack epoch has ended. Yet the legend endures - one day, the people will remember."

# Event text samples
 zaz_flavor_m_3.1.t:0 "The Free Zaporozhian State"
 zaz_flavor_m_3.1.d:0 "Against all odds, we have secured our independence! The Sich Rada meets in solemn assembly, the elected Kosh Otaman holds the symbolic mace, and our black and red banners fly over free soil. Foreign ambassadors arrive - some to congratulate, others to threaten, all to assess whether this Cossack republic can truly survive among the great powers of Europe. We have won our freedom; now we must keep it."
 
 zaz_flavor_m_4.1.t:0 "Choosing Protectors"
 zaz_flavor_m_4.1.d:0 "The Sich Rada debates far into the night, voices rising in passionate argument. 'Moscow offers Orthodox brotherhood!' shouts one colonel. 'The Ottomans offer trade and freedom!' counters another. 'We should bow to no one!' declares a third. The hetman must decide our nation's future - but in the Cossack way, the final choice belongs to the assembled warriors. The vote is called. The mace is raised. History holds its breath."

# Decision descriptions  
 zaz_relocate_sich_title:0 "Relocate the Sich"
 zaz_relocate_sich_desc:0 "The Sich must be mobile, able to relocate when enemies approach or when the Dnipro changes its course. Throughout our history, we have built new Sichs on different islands and banks: Khortytsia, Tomakivka, Chortomlyk, Oleshky, Kamyanka, and finally the New Sich. Each relocation preserves our freedom while adapting to new circumstances."

 zaz_great_rada_title:0 "Convene the Great Rada"
 zaz_great_rada_desc:0 "In times of crisis, the Kosh Otaman must summon the Great Rada - an assembly where every Cossack, regardless of rank, has voice and vote. Here, matters of war and peace, alliance and rebellion, are decided by the warriors themselves. This is the essence of Cossack liberty - democratic, direct, and sometimes chaotic, but always responsive to the people's will."

 zaz_register_reform_title:0 "Reform the Register"
 zaz_register_reform_desc:0 "The eternal tension between 'registered' and 'unregistered' Cossacks threatens our unity. The register guarantees pay and privileges but limits our numbers and freedom. We must either expand the register to include all free Cossacks, abolish it entirely in favor of universal military service, or maintain the status quo and manage the resulting tensions."

# === NEW MECHANICS LOCALIZATIONS ===

# Decisions
 zaz_convene_great_rada_title:0 "Convene the Great Rada"
 zaz_convene_great_rada_desc:0 "The Sich Rada is the supreme democratic assembly where all free Cossacks may voice their will. When momentous decisions face our Host - whether to wage war, elect new officers, or chart our future course - the Kish Otaman summons the entire brotherhood to assembly. This is the ancient tradition that distinguishes us from all other powers."
 
 zaz_launch_chaiky_raid_title:0 "Launch Chaiky Raid"
 zaz_launch_chaiky_raid_desc:0 "Our swift chaiky boats - shallow-drafted vessels that can navigate rivers and brave the Black Sea - are the terror of Ottoman admirals and Crimean slave traders alike. Let us gather our naval warriors and strike at the enemy's coastline, bringing fire and freedom to those who would chain our people."
 
 zaz_expand_register_title:0 "Expand the Cossack Register"
 zaz_expand_register_desc:0 "Our overlords have long sought to control our numbers through the register - offering pay and privileges only to officially recognized Cossacks while forcing others into serfdom.
