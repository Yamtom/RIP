# RAID MECHANICS MODIFIERS (Wild Fields, Cossacks, Tatars, Polesia)
# =========================================================================
# HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
# Raiding was a fundamental economic and military activity in the steppe
# frontier zone (Wild Fields) from the 14th-18th centuries. Key participants:
# - Crimean Tatars: Slave raids into Poland-Lithuania, Muscovy
# - Zaporozhian Cossacks: Counter-raids, Black Sea expeditions (chaiky)
# - Polesian irregulars: Marsh-based guerrilla raids
# - Don Cossacks: Raids into Ottoman territories
#
# Economic importance:
# - Slave trade generated 10-20% of Crimean revenue
# - Cossack raids disrupted Ottoman trade routes
# - Livestock/goods plunder sustained frontier economies
#
# GAME MECHANICS:
# - Raid preparation: Building forces, gathering intelligence
# - Raid execution: Success/failure based on military strength, terrain
# - Raid consequences: Loot, prestige, diplomatic penalties, unrest
# - Counter-raid mechanics: Defensive preparations, retaliation
