## Historical Background

The Union of Brest (1596) created the Greek Catholic Church as an attempt to unite Orthodox and Catholic traditions. Metropolitan Rahoza and several bishops accepted papal authority while preserving Eastern liturgy. This created:

- **Supporters:** Catholic nobility, some Orthodox bishops, Rome
- **Opponents:** Orthodox brotherhoods, Cossacks, Moscow
- **Result:** Centuries of religious tension and cultural synthesis

## Tips for Players

✓ Convert early (1596) for maximum spread time
✓ Protect Lviv - it's your reformation center
✓ Balance Eastern tradition with Western connections
✓ Use education bonuses for tech advantage
✓ Manage multi-religious provinces with tolerance
✓ Watch for Moscow's interference events
✓ Ally Papal States for protection
✓ Consider alt-history "Greek Catholic Empire" path
