 # STEPPE RAIDING SYSTEM - Events and Modifiers
 # Based on historical Crimean Tatar, Nogai, and nomadic raids (1444-1700s)
 # Yasyr (Ясир) - Russian/Ukrainian term for captives taken in slave raids
 
 # ========================================
 # RAID LAUNCH EVENT
 # ========================================
 
 steppe_raid.1.t: "Organize Raiding Party"
 steppe_raid.1.d: "The tribes grow restless, and our warriors yearn for glory and plunder. Our scouts report that the sedentary kingdoms to the north are ripe for raiding. Their fields are full of grain, their towns hold treasures, and most importantly - their people can be taken as yasyr, captives to be sold in the slave markets of Kaffa and Constantinople.\n\nA successful raid would bring wealth to our people, strengthen the loyalty of our warriors, and remind our neighbors of the power of the steppe. However, organizing such an expedition requires resources and manpower, and there is always risk that our enemies may have prepared defenses."
 steppe_raid.1.a: "To horse! The steppe calls for plunder!"
 steppe_raid.1.b: "Our warriors must remain at home this year."
 
 # ========================================
 # TARGET RECEIVES RAID
 # ========================================
 
 steppe_raid.2.t: "Steppe Raiders Approach!"
 steppe_raid.2.d: "Riders bearing grim tidings have arrived from our borderlands. A massive raiding party of [From.GetAdjective] horsemen has been sighted crossing into our territory. The nomads move swiftly, their light cavalry outpacing our defenders.\n\nThey strike at farms and villages, taking livestock, goods, and most horrifyingly - our people as captives, or 'yasyr' as they call them. These unfortunate souls will be dragged to distant slave markets unless we act decisively.\n\nWe can marshal troops to defend the border, though this will cost us precious military resources. Or we may be forced to accept the devastation and work to rebuild afterwards."
 steppe_raid.2.a: "Mobilize all available forces! Protect our people!"
 steppe_raid.2.b: "God help us... we cannot stop them."
 
 # ========================================
 # RAID OUTCOMES
 # ========================================
 
 steppe_raid.3.t: "Raid Repelled"
 steppe_raid.3.d: "Our warriors returned with bitter news. The [From.GetAdjective] forces were prepared for our raid, with troops positioned along their borders and fortifications manned. After several skirmishes, our riders were forced to withdraw with little to show for their efforts.\n\nMany warriors fell in the fighting, and we return empty-handed. The tribes will grumble about this failure, and our enemies will gain confidence from having repelled our raid."
 steppe_raid.3.a: "A setback, but we shall return stronger."
 
 steppe_raid.4.t: "Successful Raid - The Yasyr"
 steppe_raid.4.d: "Our warriors return in triumph! The raid into [From.GetName] was a resounding success. Our horsemen struck deep into their territory, evading their slow-moving armies and striking at their richest settlements.\n\nThe plunder is substantial - livestock, goods, gold, and silver. But most valuable are the thousands of captives, the 'yasyr', that we have taken. These unfortunate [From.GetAdjective] peasants, townfolk, and even some nobles will fetch excellent prices in the slave markets of Kaffa, Constantinople, and beyond.\n\nShall we sell them all immediately for maximum profit, or perhaps hold some for ransom?"
 steppe_raid.4.a: "Take the yasyr to the slave markets!"
 steppe_raid.4.b: "Offer to return them... for the right price."
 
 steppe_raid.5.t: "Ransom the Captives"
 steppe_raid.5.d: "Word has reached us from the [From.GetAdjective] raiders who struck our lands. They hold thousands of our people - men, women, and children - taken as yasyr during their raid. These captives are being held in camps on the steppe, awaiting sale to slave traders.\n\nThe raiders have sent envoys offering to return our people... for a substantial ransom. They demand gold and silver in exchange for releasing the captives. Many noble families are pleading for us to pay, desperate to recover their relatives. But the cost is steep, and some counsel that we cannot afford to reward these brigands.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 steppe_raid.5.a: "Pay the ransom. We must save our people."
 steppe_raid.5.b: "We cannot afford this. Their fate is sealed."
 
 # ========================================
 # COSSACK COUNTER-RAIDS
 # ========================================
 
 steppe_raid.6.t: "Cossacks Demand Vengeance"
 steppe_raid.6.d: "The Cossacks are enraged! The [From.GetAdjective] raiders took many of their kinsmen as yasyr in their recent raid, and the free Cossacks will not let this stand. Their atamans have come before us demanding permission to launch a retaliatory strike.\n\nThey plan to raid deep into [From.GetName], striking back at the nomads with the same tactics used against us. The Cossacks excel at such lightning raids, and success could restore some of our lost prestige. However, this would certainly worsen our relations with the [From.GetAdjective] khan.\n\nWhat is our response?"
 steppe_raid.6.a: "Go with our blessing, Cossacks!"
 steppe_raid.6.b: "No. We must not escalate this conflict."
 
 steppe_raid.7.t: "Cossack Raiders Strike!"
 steppe_raid.7.d: "Disaster! [From.GetAdjective] Cossacks have struck deep into our territory in a devastating revenge raid. These fierce warriors moved with incredible speed, burning settlements, seizing livestock, and even capturing some of our own people.\n\nThe Cossacks showed no mercy, seeing this as righteous vengeance for our earlier raids. They have withdrawn before our forces could intercept them, leaving devastation in their wake. This humiliation will not be easily forgotten."
 steppe_raid.7.a: "Cossack dogs! This is not over!"
 
 # ========================================
 # MIGRATION EVENTS
 # ========================================
 
 steppe_raid.8.t: "Nogai Refugees Seek Shelter"
 steppe_raid.8.d: "The Nogai Horde, once a powerful confederation of Tatar clans, has been shattered by their enemies. Thousands of Nogai refugees - warriors, herders, and their families - have arrived at our borders seeking sanctuary.\n\nThe Nogai Tatars are renowned horsemen and warriors. If we grant them lands in our territories along the steppe frontier - in Kuban, Yedisan, or Budjak - they would serve as excellent border guards against future raids. Their cavalry could significantly strengthen our military capabilities.\n\nHowever, settling such a large nomadic population is not without risk. What shall we do?"
 steppe_raid.8.a: "Grant them lands. We welcome the Nogai!"
 steppe_raid.8.b: "We cannot accommodate so many refugees."
 
 steppe_raid.9.t: "The Kalmyk Migration"
 steppe_raid.9.d: "An extraordinary event has occurred! The Kalmyks, a Buddhist Oirat Mongol people, have migrated thousands of miles westward from the steppes of Mongolia. Fleeing conflicts with the Dzungar Khanate and seeking new pastures, they have arrived at our borders near the Caspian Sea and the lower Volga.\n\nThe Kalmyks bring with them tens of thousands of expert horsemen and their herds. They request permission to settle in the Lower Volga region, offering to become our subjects in exchange for protection and grazing rights. Their cavalry would be a powerful addition to our forces.\n\nHowever, if we refuse, they may simply take the land by force. What is our decision?"
 steppe_raid.9.a: "Accept them as subjects of the Tsar."
 steppe_raid.9.b: "Refuse them - prepare for battle!"
 
 # ========================================
 # ZASECHNAYA CHERTA
 # ========================================
 
 steppe_raid.10.t: "Zasechnaya Cherta - The Great Abatis Line"
 steppe_raid.10.d: "For generations, our southern borderlands have suffered from devastating raids by the Crimean Tatars and other steppe nomads. Thousands of our people have been taken as yasyr, countless villages burned, and vast areas left desolate.\n\nOur military advisors propose an ambitious solution: the Zasechnaya Cherta, a massive defensive line running hundreds of miles along our southern frontier. This system would consist of fortified towns, wooden palisades, earth ramparts, and most importantly - zaseki, zones of felled trees creating impenetrable barriers to cavalry.\n\nWatchtowers manned year-round would provide early warning of raids, while garrison troops and service-class cavalry could respond quickly to incursions. This would be an enormous undertaking requiring significant investment, but it could finally secure our southern frontier."
 steppe_raid.10.a: "Begin construction of the Great Abatis Line!"
 steppe_raid.10.b: "The cost is too great for now."
