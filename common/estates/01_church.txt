# =========================================================================
# ESTATE: CHURCH (Orthodox/Uniate Clergy; XIV–XIX ст.)
# =========================================================================
#
# HISTORICAL BACKGROUND:
# The Church estate in Ukrainian/Ruthenian lands represents the Orthodox hierarchy (metropolitan,
# bishops, abbots, parish priests) and the Uniate Hierarchy (post-1596 Brest Union), which together
# controlled vast landed properties, wielded spiritual authority over the populace, and influenced
# political decisions of princes, hetmans, and magnates. The Church served as an institutional
# anchor of state legitimacy, cultural identity, and social order—but also as a contested site
# where Rome (papal authority), Constantinople, Moscow, and local rulers competed for influence.
#
# Historical Phases:
# - XIV–XV ст. Lithuania & Poland: When Kyivan Rus' territories fell under Lithuanian-Polish rule,
#   the Orthodox Church struggled to maintain institutional integrity. Roman Catholic pressure
#   increased; Polish crown attempted to convert or subordinate Orthodox leadership; Constantinople's
#   authority was distant. Church property was often seized or confiscated; churches converted to
#   Catholic use; Orthodox clergy faced social stigma.
# - XVI ст. Polish-Lithuanian Dominance: Despite Catholic pressure, Orthodox Church remained the
#   primary institution in Ukrainian lands, with a metropolitan in Kyiv and a network of monasteries
#   and parishes. But the Church faced administrative uncertainty: not a separate estate (as in
#   Muscovy) but rather an estate of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Polish magnates patronized
#   Church buildings but also expected ecclesiastical submission.
# - XVII ст. Khmelnytsky Period & Hetmanate: Church's role transformed dramatically. Khmelnytsky's
#   uprising was explicitly styled as an Orthodox crusade against Catholic Polish oppression; clergy
#   blessed his army and provided moral legitimacy. Once Hetmanate was established, Church became
#   one of the principal estates (alongside Nobility/Starshyna and Cossacks), with a seat on the Rada
#   and significant land holdings. The metropolitan became a state power broker; monasteries served
#   as cultural centers, schools, and repositories of legitimacy.
# - XVII–XVIII ст. Brest Union (1596) & Religious Competition: In 1596, a synod at Brest attempted
#   to unite Orthodox and Catholic Churches under papal authority, creating the "Uniate" (Greek
#   Catholic) rite—Orthodox liturgy but Catholic discipline and papal obedience. This created a
#   schism: some regions/bishops accepted Uniatsm (Right Bank, Galicia); others rejected it (Left
#   Bank maintained full Orthodoxy). The split weaponized religious identity: Uniates were seen as
#   Catholic agents; Orthodox as defenders of ancient faith. Hetmans navigated this minefield
#   carefully; some favored Orthodox restoration, others made pragmatic peace with Uniates.
# - XVII ст. Mohyla Academy: Founded 1632 in Kyiv by Metropolitan Peter Mohyla; became the premier
#   institution of Orthodox learning in Eastern Europe; trained metropolitans, bishops, starshyna,
#   and secular nobles; blended Orthodox theology with Western (Counter-Reformation) scholasticism
#   and rhetoric. Mohyla's reforms strengthened Orthodox ecclesiastical discipline and intellectual
#   authority; the Academy became a symbol of Orthodox cultural resilience against Polish/Catholic
#   pressure.
# - XVIII ст. Russian Secularization: After Peter I and especially Catherine II, the Russian state
#   (which increasingly controlled Left Bank) began to secularize church lands, subordinate Church
#   to state (Holy Synod in Petersburg), and integrate Church hierarchy into state nobility system
#   (Table of Ranks). Metropolitan was appointed by tsar, not elected by synod; monastery lands were
#   confiscated; priests were obligated to serve as state informants and moral enforcers.
#
# Church Estate Structure:
# - Metropolitan (Митрополит): Primate of Orthodox Church in Kyivan lands; bishop of Kyiv; presided
#   over synod and church councils; major landowner and political advisor to hetman/prince; often a
#   starshyna member's relative or client.
# - Bishops (Єпископи): Regional ecclesiastical authorities; controlled monasteries and parishes
#   within their dioceses; landowners in their own right; could defect to rival hetmans or overlords
#   if patronage dried up.
# - Abbots & Monastic Orders: Monasteries (esp. Kyivan Caves Monastery, Pochayiv, Lviv fraternities)
#   were property-rich and politically influential; abbots negotiated with hetmans for privileges;
#   monastic schools educated noble children; monastic chroniclers shaped historical narratives.
# - Parish Priests (Священники): Lowest clerical rank; parish priest was often a younger noble's
#   son or talented villager; exercised moral authority in villages; collected tithes and church
#   fees (part went to bishop, part to priest); could ally with magnate/noble patrons or with
#   broader Orthodox communities (brotherhoods/confraternities).
# - Religious Confraternities (Братства): Lay associations (esp. in cities) that championed Orthodox
#   faith, defended church property, maintained schools, and competed with Uniate and Catholic
#   organizations. Confraternities in Lviv, Kyiv, and other cities became centers of ecclesiastical
#   and cultural resistance.
#
# Church Estate Interests & Agendas (Game Representation):
# - Ecclesiastical Authority: Church desires recognition of its right to appoint bishops, control
#   monasteries, and manage church properties independently of state control. Opposes secularization
#   and state nomination of clergy.
# - Land & Wealth: Church owns vast territories and must defend them against confiscation by state
#   or magnates. Demands tax exemptions, trade monopolies (candlemaking, salt production), and
#   tribute from parishes.
# - Religious Uniformity: Church opposes Uniate competition, Catholic pressure, and religious
#   heterodoxy. Demands state enforcement of Orthodox dominance and suppression of rival faiths.
# - Education & Culture: Church monopolizes literacy and learning through monasteries and academy;
#   desires resources for schools, book production, and cultural preservation. Uses education to
#   reinforce Orthodox identity.
# - Moral Authority: Church claims right to advise/approve state actions on religious grounds; opposes
#   policies deemed immoral (e.g., oppression of peasants, breaking oaths, etc.). Church leaders claim
#   to speak for God and invoke excommunication as political weapon.
#
# Church Privilege Mechanics (In-Game):
# - Happy/Loyal Church: +global tax modifier +20%, +papal/church influence +1, +devotion +0.5,
#   +church power modifier +10%, +monthly fervor increase +1, -stability cost -10%. Church provides
#   legitimacy, taxes, and cultural stability.
# - Neutral Church: +global tax modifier +20%. Baseline tax revenue from Church lands.
# - Angry Church: -global tax modifier -10%, -papal/church influence -1, -devotion -0.5, -church
#   power modifier -25%, -monthly fervor increase -1, +stability cost modifier +10%, +global unrest +2.
#   Angry Church can foment rebellion, refuse cooperation, and undermine state legitimacy.
#
# GAME MECHANICS (Design Notes):
# The Church estate generates influence from Church land ownership (monastery and parish holdings),
# from religious devotion (Orthodox population), and from cultural prestige (education, legitimacy).
# Church can trigger disasters (religious schism, peasant crusades, Church-State conflict) if loyalty
# drops; it can demand privileges (land grants, tax exemptions, religious monopolies) that conflict
# with secular state building. For CHR, HET: Church is a major power broker (metropolitan is hetman
# advisor, monasteries are major landowners, Church influence on starshyna decisions is significant).
# For ZAZ: Church has less material power but plays spiritual/legitimacy role (blessing raids, 
# consecrating Sich camps, etc.). For UZH, PRL: Church is a competing authority (Orthodox vs. Uniate,
# local bishops vs. metropolitan, etc.).
