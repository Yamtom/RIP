# DISORDERLY PRINCES DISASTER
# (XV ст.: 1450–1500 р.р. — литовська фрагментація Древньої Русі)
# =========================================================================
#
# HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
# This disaster simulates the fractious period after Lithuania's assertion of control over
# Kievan Rus' lands (Kyivan, Chernihiv, Volyn, Podillia, Halych regions, ~1380–1569).
# Lithuanian grand dukes ruled through indigenous Russian/Ruthenian princely vassals who
# maintained semi-autonomous courts, treasuries, and military forces, creating chronic
# instability and fragmentation (analogous to the "Disorderly Princes" period in Holy Roman Empire).
#
# Historical Background:
# - Lithuanian Expansion (XIV–XV ст.): Gediminas and successors conquered Kievan Rus' territories
#   from the Tatar-Mongol khanates and from Polish/Hungarian competitors. Rather than direct
#   annexation, Lithuania (and later Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) ruled through local princes
#   (see: Princes of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Volyn, etc.) who paid tribute and supplied troops.
# - Vassal Princes: Indigenous Ruthenian princes (descendants of Rurik dynasty in Kyiv) retained
#   hereditary titles, court hierarchies, and some judicial authority. Their allegiance to 
#   Lithuania was nominally absolute but practically negotiable (especially when Ottoman/Crimean
#   or Muscovite power seemed attractive alternatives).
# - Sources of Conflict: Overlapping claims to inheritance, disputes over tribute payment,
#   succession contests (when a prince died, relatives competed for the title; Lithuanian 
#   grand duke might arbitrate or impose a client), religious tensions (Orthodox/Uniate/Catholic),
#   and raids by Crimean Tatars or Muscovite forces destabilized vassal relationships.
# - Economic Fragmentation: Each principality maintained its own tax base, army, and trade
#   routes. No unified currency or customs system; merchants paid tolls at multiple princely
#   borders. Wars between rival princes disrupted commerce and depopulated borderlands.
# - Aristocratic Autonomy: Ruthenian boyars (nobility) within each principality held power
#   independent of both prince and Lithuanian grand duke. Boyar councils could veto princely
#   decisions or refuse military service. Princes had to balance boyar factions against
#   Lithuanian pressure—often impossible, leading to paralysis or civil war.
#
# Key Figures & Events:
# - Prince Casimir of Kyiv (d. 1471): Son of Prince Alexander; attempted to assert independence
#   from Lithuania; executed by Lithuanian grand duke Casimir IV as a warning. His execution
#   illustrates the terminal fate of princely ambition.
# - Princes of Volyn: Maintained semi-autonomous court; occasionally switched allegiance between
#   Lithuania and Poland; frequently in conflict with Mongol/Crimean raiding and with neighboring
#   princes over borders.
# - Princes of Chernihiv: More integrated into Lithuania; hereditary vassal relationship; less
#   dramatic crises than western principalities.
# - Muscovite Pressure: Beginning under Ivan III, Muscovy began absorbing western Ruthenian
#   principalities as "return of Rus' lands"; by 1500s, Muscovy had detached northern vassals
#   from Lithuanian suzerainty, increasing Lithuanian vulnerability.
#
# Structural Mechanics of Crisis:
# - Vassal Hierarchy Incoherence: Lithuanian grand duke claimed absolute sovereignty but lacked
#   administrative apparatus to enforce it without local princes' cooperation. Princes were
#   simultaneously free-ish and enslaved—a perpetual tension.
# - Inheritance Chaos: No clear succession law across the federation meant each princely death
#   triggered multi-claimant conflicts. Grand duke arbitrated but often selected weak candidates
#   (to avoid a single strong rival) or imposed outsiders (to break local power), both destabilizing.
# - Economic Strangulation: Tributary demands increased over time as Lithuania faced wars in
#   west (Poland) and east (Muscovy). Princes could not refuse but impoverished their realms;
#   unrest and flight to Crimea/Muscovy followed.
# - Religious Fragmentation: Orthodox principalities chafed under Catholic Lithuanian rule;
#   Rome and Constantinople both sought influence. Uniate compromise attempted but provoked
#   Orthodox resistance; Jesuits and Orthodox monks competed for noble patronage.
# - Foreign Intervention: Crimean khans, Ottoman sultans, Muscovite tsars, Polish kings all
#   meddled; offered alliances or threatened raids; undermined Lithuanian authority by courting
#   princely defection or by raiding in ways that made princes look weak.
#
# End of the Disorderly Period:
# - 1569 Lublin Union: Poland-Lithuania formally unified; Ukrainian/Ruthenian principalities
#   directly incorporated into Polish crown and Polish magnate lands. The fiction of vassal
#   principalities officially ended (though some magnate-ruled territories maintained nominal
#   autonomy). Kozak (Cossack) militarization accelerated as response to loss of princely authority.
# - Absorption into Cossackry: As princely power decayed, military authority devolved to cossack
#   captains and warbands; by 1600s, cossack regiments and the Sich had become the primary
#   military and political force.
#
# GAME MECHANICS (Design Notes):
# This disaster is unique in that it triggers for Lithuania (LIT) when it has a vassal subject
# (KIE — Kyiv) with high liberty desire (simulating princely rebellion or defection). The disaster
# represents Lithuania's loss of control over its far-eastern principalities—a prelude to either
# their absorption into Muscovy or their transformation into cossack/Polish-ruled territories.
# It progresses on vassal unrest and foreign pressure, and regresses as Lithuania restores
# prestige and stability.
#
# TIMELINE RESTRICTION: The disaster is currently restricted to "Age of Discovery" (1440–1517),
# but historically the period of vassal principalities extended from XIV ст. through the 1569
# Lublin Union. The Age of Discovery restriction may be too narrow; game balance may require
# extending to "Age of Absolutism" (1625+) to simulate the later collapse of vassal system.
# Alternatively, a separate disaster could model the XIV–XV ст. period of initial fragmentation.
#
# Historical Mechanics:
# - Vassal Fragmentation: Ruthenian principalities maintained nominal independence but increasing
#   tribute and control; overlord Lithuania unable to centralize without war
# - Boyar Factionalism: Local nobility factions compete for control of each principality;
#   overlord authority weak in practice
# - External Pressure: Muscovite expansion, Crimean raids, Polish magnate influence all exploit
#   Lithuania's inability to consolidate rule over distant vassals
# - Religious Conflict: Orthodox vs. Catholic/Uniate tensions weaponized by rival powers
#   seeking to detach territories from Lithuanian suzerainty
#
# Narrative: The disaster simulates the instability of Lithuania's eastern frontier, where
# loosely-controlled Ruthenian principalities frequently rebelled, were raided, or switched
# allegiance to competing powers. By 1569 (Lublin Union), the fiction of autonomous princes
# ended, and territories were directly absorbed or ceded to Muscovy/Crimea.
