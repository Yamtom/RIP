Our state once stood on this land and was the last bastion of Rus' resistance against the Mongol Horde. While Kyiv has gained independence like us, the devastation caused by the horde prevents it from acting as the center of a once-powerful state like Rus'. Thus, by uniting Halych-Volhynia, we shall unite all of Rus', despite the roadblocks we will undoubtedly face."

It was attended by the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaeologus, Patriarch Joseph II of Constantinople, and Metropolitan Isidore of Kyiv, who represented the Church of Rus'. The Florentine Union was signed in July 1439, which recognized the Pope's supremacy, adopted Catholic dogmas, and preserved Eastern Christian rites. As a result, there is a strong desire in the Ruthenian states to accept this church union at the state level. However, there are both supporters and opponents of the union, including the self-proclaimed center of Orthodoxy in Muscovy, where the church is known to be subordinated to the Tsar, and the new Ecumenical Patriarchate, which has become a puppet of the Ottomans in the holy city of Constantinople."

Our neighbors can come to our aid, but we are no longer afraid of them. The monarchs of Europe will never again enslave free steppe peoples!"
