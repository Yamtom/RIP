	# UZHHOROD GOVERNMENT TITLES – PALANOK & KOMITAT SYSTEM
	# -----------------------------------------------------------------
	# TECHNICAL NOTES:
	# - Both blocks below are scoped by has_reform checks, ensuring the
	#   name-set swaps only when the Palanok Captaincy or Komitat System
	#   reforms are active. Rank ladders map directly to EU4 government
	#   tiers (duchy/kingdom/empire equivalents):
	#     * rank[1] = March (Tier 1), rank[2] = Polk (Tier 2),
	#       rank[3] = Governorate (Tier 3).
	# - Ruler titles differentiate male/female variants to keep flavor in
	#   UI tooltips, monarch lists, and succession events. Localization
	#   keys follow uppercase identifiers declared here (e.g. PALATINE,
	#   KAPITAN) and must exist in government names l_*.yml files.
	# - `uzh_palanok_captaincy_reform` works with early-mission reform
	#   (see common/government_reforms/RIP_government_reforms.txt) granting
	#   march-style autonomy; `uzh_komitat_system_reform` is unlocked later
	#   via mission "Komitat System" replacing hereditary captaincy.
	#
	# NARRATIVE BACKGROUND:
	# - Palanok Captaincy: Inspired by the Palanok (Mukachevo) fortress,
	#   historically run by captains (kapitány) drawn from Drugeth/Rákóczi
	#   lineages. Titles like KAPITAN / KAPITANSHA evoke border-march
	#   command, while POLKOVNYK and PAN_GENERAL echo Cossack/Polish ranks
	#   adopted by Rusyn elites guarding the Tysa passes.
	# - Komitat System: References the integration of Zakarpattia into the
	#   Hungarian comitatus/megye administration. NADKOMIT (chief county
	#   magistrate) and KORONNY_MARSHAL borrow from Habsburg-Hungarian
	#   terminology, culminating in PALATINE / PALATINESS for crown
	#   governors managing the March under St. Stephen's laws.
	#
	# SOURCES & FURTHER READING:
	# - Géza Pálffy, "The Origins of the Border Fortresses of Royal Hungary"
	#   (Hungarian Historical Review, 2015) on Palanok captaincies.
	# - Ivan Pop, *History of Transcarpathia* (Uzhhorod, 2002) detailing
	#   comitat governance reforms in the 18th century.
