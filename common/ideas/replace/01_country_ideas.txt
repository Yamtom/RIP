# CHERNIHIV (CHR) NATIONAL IDEAS – LEFT BANK FRONTIER ADAPTATION
# =========================================================================
# HISTORICAL CONTEXT (XV-XIX ст.):
# Chernihiv evolved from medieval principality → frontier garrison state →
# grain-export economy under Russian imperialism.
#
# DISTINCT DEVELOPMENT PATH:
# Unlike Zaporizhia (military raiding economy) or Hetmanate (regimental
# system), Chernihiv SURVIVED through agricultural specialization and
# diplomatic adaptation to Russian rule.
#
# KEY PERIODS:
# - XV ст.: Desna principality, "concord compacts" with Poland-Lithuania
# - XVII ст.: Ruina (1657-1687) devastation, recovery via grain exports
# - XVIII ст.: Sloboda system (military-agricultural settlements) expansion
# - XIX ст.: Russian Imperial grain monopoly—Chernihiv became major supplier
#
# STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES:
# - Agricultural: Chernozem soils supported grain production (millet, rye, wheat)
# - Trade: Desna-Dnieper corridor connected to Black Sea grain markets
# - Diplomatic: Maintained neutrality between Russian, Ottoman, Polish powers
# - Frontier: Garrison system (kompaniya, slobody) balanced defense & settlement
#
# SURVIVAL STRATEGY:
# Rather than military power (like Zaporizhia) or regimental autonomy (like
# Hetmanate), Chernihiv made itself INDISPENSABLE to Russian economy via
# grain supply. Economic integration prevented suppression (unlike Sich 1775)
# but cost political autonomy.
#
# IDEA MECHANICS:
# - Emphasis: Morale, manpower recovery, diplomatic reputation, trade bonuses
# - Weakness: No military specialization (unlike cossack_ideas)
# - Focus: Frontier stability, agricultural production, border negotiation

	# ZAPORIZHIAN SICH (ZAZ) NATIONAL IDEAS – DEMOCRATIC MILITARY REPUBLIC
	# =========================================================================
	# HISTORICAL CONTEXT (XVI-XVIII ст.):
	# Zaporizhia represented unique political system: military democracy based on
	# elected leadership, shared property (komunna), and direct assembly voting
	# (General Rada). No social hierarchy—elected otamans served 1-year terms with
	# strict limits on power accumulation.
	#
	# ECONOMIC BASE: Black Sea raiding (chaiky), merchant ship attacks, Ottoman
	# tribute payments, river commerce tolls, fishing, salt production.
	# High-risk, high-reward economy based on military specialization.
	#
	# MILITARY CHARACTER:
	# - Cavalry specialists: Light steppe cavalry, shock tactics, rapid maneuvers
	# - Naval: Shallow-draft chaiky boats for Black Sea operations
	# - Weakness: Poor siege warfare, vulnerable to artillery
	# - Strength: Island fortification, defensive depth, rapid mobilization
	#
	# IDEA SELECTION RATIONALE:
	# - loot_amount: Represents raiding economy (chaiky commerce attacks)
	# - manpower_recovery: Rapid recruitment of registered & free Cossacks
	# - development_cost: Democratic communities' ability to mobilize resources
	# - steppe_riders: Cavalry specialization reflecting Sich's mounted strength
	# - hit_and_run: Tactical specialization (rapid raids, avoidance of pitched battles)\n# - tolerance: Religious pluralism (Orthodox, Muslim, Catholic Cossacks coexisted)
	# - army_cost: Militia-based system with lower maintenance (paid from loot)
	#
	# HISTORICAL CHALLENGES:
	# - Internal democracy slow for centralized decisions (cost: +stability_cost)
	# - Cavalry strength doesn't translate to siege capability
	# - Dependent on raiding economy (vulnerable if Ottoman/Turkish pressure rises)
	# - 1775: Russian suppression ended 223-year democratic experiment
