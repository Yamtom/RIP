# ESTATE: COSSACKS (XVI–XIX ст.)
# =========================================================================
#
# HISTORICAL BACKGROUND:
# The Cossack estate (Козацтво) represents the military-democratic community of free warriors,
# organized by territory (Registered Cossacks, Zaporozhian Sich, Cossack Regiments, Don/Kuban
# hosts) and by charter rights (exemption from serfdom, land grants, military service in exchange
# for autonomy, democratic rada councils, elective leadership). From XVI ст. onward, cossacks
# evolved from border raiders and mercenaries into a major estate with territorial holdings,
# political power (seat on hetman councils), and cultural identity.
#
# Historical Development:
# - XVI ст. Origins: Polish-Lithuanian Crown attempts to formalize "registered cossack" corps
#   (rejestr; ~500–2000 men) for frontier defense; bulk of cossackry remains unregistered (free,
#   autonomous). Zaporozhian Sich consolidates as semi-independent host in the steppes south of
#   the Dnieper.
# - XVII ст. Expansion: Khmelnytsky's Uprising (1648) elevates cossacks from military order to
#   political estate; cossack officers (starshyna) become principal advisors to hetman; cossack
#   lands are expanded; registry swells to 60,000+ men. Hetmanate's core military and administrative
#   power flows through cossack estate and its representatives on the Rada.
# - XVII–XVIII ст. Golden Age: Cossacks dominate Hetmanate politics; each hetman must negotiate
#   with cossack generals and the Sich council. Registered regiments (Chernihiv, Pereiaslav,
#   Cherkasy, Mirhorod, etc.) form the backbone of Hetmanate army. Cossack officers (koshivyy
#   otaman, judge, chancellor, clerk) compete with hetman for supremacy.
# - XVIII ст. Decline: Russian pressure after Poltava (1709) progressively centralizes and
#   co-opts cossack estate. Individual officers are inducted into Russian nobility (Table of Ranks);
#   regiments are reorganized into standing military units under Russian command; autonomy of Sich
#   and elective councils curtailed. By 1775, Zaporozhian Sich is eliminated by Catherine II;
#   cossack estate is reduced to a Russian military service category.
# - XIX ст. Persistence: Cossack identity survives in Black Sea Cossacks (Kuban, Caucasus), Don
#   Cossacks, and cultural memory; but political estate power is extinct; cossacks are now Russian
#   imperial cavalry and border troops.
#
# Cossack Estate Structure:
# - Registered Cossacks (Реєстр): Formally enrolled, paid stipend (sometimes), bound by oath;
#   fewer freedoms than unregistered. Typically 500–5,000+ men at any time.
# - Unregistered/"Wild" Cossacks (Невреєстровані): Free, autonomous, self-supporting; largest
#   population; form raiding bands, join Sich, or settle frontier; exempt from obligations.
# - Zaporozhian Sich: Most famous; semi-autonomous republic on islands of lower Dnieper;
#   democratic rada; elected kosh otaman; no hereditary leadership; welcoming to all comers
#   (serfs, brigands, religious refugees, foreign mercenaries); financed by raiding and trade
#   monopolies (salt, furs, slaves); notorious for fearlessness and indiscipline.
# - Cossack Regiments (Полки): Territorial military units (Chernihiv, Pereiaslav, Kaniv, Cherkasy,
#   etc.); officers (regimental hetman, judge, esaul) form starshyna; soldiers are registered
#   cossacks with land allotments; regiments rotate into hetman's service and garrison duty.
# - Rada Council: Assembly of all cossacks (or delegates) that elected hetman, kosh otaman,
#   judges; decisions by consensus or majority vote; represented cossackry as collective political
#   force.
#
# Cossack Estate Interests & Agendas (Game Representation):
# - Military Power: Cossacks desire strong offensive capabilities (cavalry, raiding bonuses) and
#   territorial expansion (new steppe/lands for settlement and raiding); enemy wealth is perceived
#   as opportunity for plunder.
# - Autonomy & Democracy: Cossacks resist centralization, standing bureaucracy, and hereditary
#   hierarchies; they favor elective councils, democratic decision-making, and local self-governance.
#   They particularly resist integration into foreign (e.g., Russian, Polish) military systems that
#   eliminate their autonomy.
# - Economic Rights: Cossacks demand trade monopolies, tax exemptions, land grants, and free use of
#   steppes/rivers; they oppose serfdom (since it competes with cossack recruitment) and noble
#   land monopolies.
# - Religious Freedom: Orthodox/Uniate cossacks resist Catholic Polish pressure and secular Russian
#   centralization; they demand protection of Orthodox faith and ecclesiastical autonomy.
# - Raiding Rights: Cossacks (especially Sich) demand freedom to raid, privateering rights,
#   merchant trading privileges, and safe passage for loot/slaves. They view raiding as economic
#   and martial right, not brigandage.
#
# Cossack Privilege Mechanics (In-Game):
# - Happy/Loyal Cossacks: +cavalry cost -20%, +cavalry power +20%, +cavalry-to-infantry ratio
#   (reflecting military specialization and confidence). Modifies estate loyalty upward.
# - Neutral Cossacks: +cavalry power +20% (baseline military bonus).
# - Angry Cossacks: +cavalry cost +20%, -cavalry power -10%, +global unrest +2 (rebellion risk,
#   refusal of service, raiding against own territory).
#
# This estate represents the military aristocracy of the steppes and the democratic counter-balance
# to princely/hetman absolutism. When satisfied, cossacks fight fiercely and dominate the military
# sphere; when angry, they rebel, mutiny, or switch allegiance to rival powers.
#
# GAME MECHANICS (Design Notes):
# In EU4 terms, the Cossack estate generates influence from steppe provinces (natural habitat),
# from size of Cossack regiments/armies, and from military traditions. The estate can trigger
# disasters (cossack rebellions, internal coups) if loyalty drops too low; it can also demand
# privileges (land rights, military leadership, autonomy) that conflict with centralization goals.
# For ZAZ, HET, CHR: cossacks form the core of military power and political legitimacy.
# For KRU, KIE: cossacks represent the militarized frontier against Crimea/Ottoman/Muscovy.
# For VOL, PRL, UZH: cossacks are less dominant but still significant as frontier cavalry.
