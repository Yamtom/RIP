 HET_exiles_and_freedom_seekers:0 "No Longer Exiled"
 HET_exiles_and_freedom_seekers_desc:0 "The Hetmanate's lands are distinct from those of the Holy Roman Empire, Russia, or the Ottoman Empire.

The longer we keep these heirlooms of the past, the more prestigious we will be in the eyes of future generations and foreigners."
#Decision
 volyn_halich_nation_title:0 "Restoration of Halycia-Volhynia"
 volyn_halich_nation_desc:0 "We must reclaim the title of King Danylo Halytskyi Romanovych, bestowed upon him by Pope Innocent IV. Our state once stood on this land and was the last bastion of Rus' resistance against the Mongol Horde. While Kyiv has gained independence like us, the devastation caused by the horde prevents it from acting as the center of a once-powerful state like Rus'. Thus, by uniting Halych-Volhynia, we shall unite all of Rus', despite the roadblocks we will undoubtedly face."
 hetmanate_nation_title: "Not Polish, Not Russian, but Ruthenian!"
 hetmanate_nation_desc: "The incursions of both Poles and Russians into our land have caused conflicts, as the Ottomans from the south and the Tatars from the east also seek our land.

It is time to put an end to the destruction brought by these enemies on all sides! We find solace and strength in our military potential, but we are not devoid of independent ambition for all of Ruthenia!"

Even when the local rulers were pagan, they considered accepting Islam, but ultimately accepted Christianity. History, however, corrected this tragic error by bringing the faith of Muhammad to these lands. From here, it will spread to every corner of the globe."
#Events "Council of Florence and the Host of the Cossacks"
 ukr_flavor.1.t:0 "Joining the Council of Florence"
 ukr_flavor.1.d:0 "The Council of Florence was the 17th Ecumenical Council convened by Pope Eugene IV between 1431 and 1449. It was attended by the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaeologus, Patriarch Joseph II of Constantinople, and Metropolitan Isidore of Kyiv, who represented the Church of Rus'. The Florentine Union was signed in July 1439, which recognized the Pope's supremacy, adopted Catholic dogmas, and preserved Eastern Christian rites. As a result, there is a strong desire in the Ruthenian states to accept this church union at the state level. However, there are both supporters and opponents of the union, including the self-proclaimed center of Orthodoxy in Muscovy, where the church is known to be subordinated to the Tsar, and the new Ecumenical Patriarchate, which has become a puppet of the Ottomans in the holy city of Constantinople."

We declared our independence from the state known as Zaporozhia, whose main estate is the so-called Cossacks, and we declared our independence from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Our neighbors can come to our aid, but we are no longer afraid of them. The monarchs of Europe will never again enslave free steppe peoples!"
 zaz_flavor.1a:0 "Cossacks will never, ever, ever be enslaved."
 zaz_flavor.1b:0 "Nope."
 cossack_host:0 "The Host of the Cossacks"
 desc_cossack_host:0 "The Cossacks of Zaporozhia founded, managed, and protected the state, relying on these fearless horsemen in every aspect of their existence, giving freely. We don't have to pay our Cossacks in money, but other forms of warfare come at a price, which is exacerbated by our tense relations with neighboring imperialists."
