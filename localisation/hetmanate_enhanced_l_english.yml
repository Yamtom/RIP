 het_enhanced.1.t:0 "The Question of Hetman Succession"
 het_enhanced.1.d:0 "A critical debate rages in the Hetmanate: should the office of Hetman remain elective, as in the democratic Sich tradition, or should we allow hereditary succession to ensure stability and prevent Russian interference? The Starshyna elite increasingly favor dynasty, while common Cossacks defend their right to elect. This decision will define our political future."
 het_enhanced.1.a:0 "The Rada must elect all Hetmans—democracy is sacred!"
 het_enhanced.1.b:0 "Allow hereditary succession—stability demands it."
 het_enhanced.1.c:0 "Compromise: limited hereditary rights with Rada approval."
 
 het_enhanced.2.t:0 "Starshyna Oligarchy Demands"
 het_enhanced.2.d:0 "The Starshyna—the Cossack officer class—have evolved into a wealthy landed nobility. They demand formal recognition of their privileges, including hereditary estates, tax exemptions, and greater political power. Granting these demands would transform the Hetmanate into an oligarchy, but refusing risks their rebellion."
 het_enhanced.2.a:0 "Grant the Starshyna their privileges."
 het_enhanced.2.b:0 "The Hetman answers to no oligarchs!"
 
 het_enhanced.3.t:0 "Left Bank or Right Bank?"
 het_enhanced.3.d:0 "The Hetmanate straddles the Dnieper River, divided between Left Bank (under Russian influence) and Right Bank (contested with Poland). The Andrussovo Treaty formalized this division, but we must decide where to concentrate our resources and political attention. This choice will determine our alignment for decades to come."
 het_enhanced.3.a:0 "Prioritize the Left Bank—Russia is our protector."
 het_enhanced.3.b:0 "Maintain unity of both banks at all costs."
 het_enhanced.3.c:0 "Focus on the Right Bank—Poland offers more autonomy."
 
 het_enhanced.4.t:0 "Russian Interference in Elections"
 het_enhanced.4.d:0 "The Tsar's agents arrive at the Rada with a 'recommendation' for our next Hetman—a candidate loyal to Moscow who will ensure compliance with Russian interests. We can accept this interference to preserve good relations, or assert our autonomy by electing our own choice, risking Russian displeasure."
 het_enhanced.4.a:0 "Accept the Russian candidate—pragmatism prevails."
 het_enhanced.4.b:0 "We elect our own Hetman! Our autonomy is not negotiable!"
 
 het_enhanced.5.t:0 "The Mazepa Crisis: Swedish Alliance?"
 het_enhanced.5.d:0 "Hetman Ivan Mazepa faces an impossible choice. The Great Northern War rages, and Sweden's Charles XII offers alliance against Russia. This could be our chance for true independence—but if Sweden loses, the consequences will be catastrophic. The fate of the Hetmanate hangs on this decision."
 het_enhanced.5.a:0 "Ally with Sweden—independence or death!"
 het_enhanced.5.b:0 "Remain loyal to Russia. Mazepa's gambit is madness."
 
 het_enhanced.6.t:0 "The Little Russian Collegium"
 het_enhanced.6.d:0 "Tsar Peter establishes the Little Russian Collegium—a Russian oversight body that will supervise the Hetman's decisions and gradually absorb our autonomy into the imperial administration. This is the beginning of the end of Hetmanate independence. Do we accept this subjugation, or resist?"
 het_enhanced.6.a:0 "Accept the Collegium. Resistance is futile."
 het_enhanced.6.b:0 "We will not bow to Russian bureaucrats!"
 
 het_enhanced.7.t:0 "Abolition of the Hetmanate"
 het_enhanced.7.d:0 "Catherine II has issued the decree: the office of Hetman is abolished. The Hetmanate will be dissolved and fully integrated into the Russian Empire as Little Russia Governorate. Our centuries-old Cossack autonomy ends today—unless we are willing to fight for it."
 het_enhanced.7.a:0 "Accept abolition. The Hetmanate's time has passed."
 het_enhanced.7.b:0 "Fight for our freedom! War against the Empire!"
 het_enhanced.7.c:0 "Negotiate for limited cultural and administrative autonomy."
 
 het_enhanced.8.t:0 "Cossack Revival Movement"
 het_enhanced.8.d:0 "Despite surviving the threat of abolition, we face a choice about our identity. Should we revive the traditional Cossack military culture and democratic traditions that defined our ancestors? Or should we embrace European modernity and transform into a modern state?"
 het_enhanced.8.a:0 "Revive the ancient Cossack traditions!"
 het_enhanced.8.b:0 "Modernize as a European state."
