 HET_toward_all_of_ruthenia_desc:0 "Despite the Poles' and Russians' best efforts to subjugate this fertile land we call home, we reject them at every turn!

Power is best shared among proven people with years of experience, and these years of experience will ensure that they are well-known and respected."

 HET_exiles_and_freedom_seekers_desc:0 "The Hetmanate's lands are quite distinct from those of the Holy Roman Empire, the Russian land, or even the Ottoman.

 HET_cossack_infantry_supremacy:0 "On Foot Supremacy"
 HET_cossack_infantry_supremacy_desc:0 "The Hetmanate is no longer reliant on cavalry-based strategies, despite the fact that the open fields of Ruthenia are known for their cavalry and the steppe people who practiced cavalry tactics without end.

The more we encourage this within our own ranks, the better equipped we will be to repel invasions into Ruthenia."
 HET_the_price_we_set_for_service:0 "Peak Performance at a Premium Price"
 HET_the_price_we_set_for_service_desc:0 "Other European and Muslim countries have taken notice of our battle performance to the point where we have received offers to rent out certain regiments for service elsewhere.

 HET_kleinody:0 "Kleinody!"
 HET_kleinody_desc:0 "These Kleinody - a kind of imperial regalia, are prestigious and honorable objects for the Zaporozhian Host, and only a few in our ranks ever obtain them.

The longer we keep these glorious heirlooms of the past, the more prestigious we will be in the eyes of future generations and foreigners."

As a result, after uniting the state of Halicia-Volhynia, we will unite all of Rus'. Although there are other roadblocks on the way that we will undoubtedly encounter."
 hetmanate_nation_title: "Not Polish, Not Russian, but Ruthenian!"
 hetmanate_nation_desc: "The incursions of both the Poles and the Russians into our land have been the cause of several conflicts since the Ottomans from the south also seek our land in conjunction with Tatars from the east. Fields have burned, villages have been shattered, and entire upstart leaders have been slain in order to subjugate this land of Ruthenia for the likes of foreign states and leaders. Now, brothers and sisters, it is time that we put an end to the destruction brought to us by these enemies on all sides! Though we find solace and strength in our military potential, it does not mean we are devoid of independent ambition for all of Ruthenia!"
 kuyaba_nation_title:0 "The Slavic homeland Under Allah's protection "
 kuyaba_nation_desc:0 "This land was known as Kuyaba, and Abu Zayd al-Balhi was the one who gave it that name. Ancient cartographers described the local people as savages, but this confederation of tribes was the economic, commercial, and political center behind them. Even when the local rulers were pagans, they thought accepting Islam, but not, they accepted Christianity. However, history corrected this tragic error by bringing Muhammad's faith to these lands. From there, it will spread to every corner of the globe."

However, it has both supporters and opponents, including the self-proclaimed center of Orthodoxy in Muscovy, where the church is known to be subordinated to the tsar, and the new Ecumenical Patriarchate, which has become a puppet of the Ottomans in the holy city of Constantinople."
