## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Q: How do I convert to Russian Orthodox?**
A: Use the "Embrace Third Rome Orthodoxy" decision (in Decisions menu, Religion tab)

**Q: I don't see the decision to convert**
A: You need to be Orthodox AND either (1) control Moscow, OR (2) be Russian culture, OR (3) have the "Third Rome" event fire

**Q: My provinces have massive unrest after forced conversion**
A: Expected. Use "Religious Unity" blessing or wait it out. Don't force convert too many provinces at once.

**Q: Should I take "Forced Russification" aspect?**
A: Only if you're actively culture converting. Otherwise, skip it for military/economic aspects.

**Q: When should I establish the Inquisition?**
A: When you have many heretic/heathen provinces causing religious unity problems. Not needed early game.

**Q: Can I switch back to regular Orthodox?**
A: No, conversion is permanent (like Protestant/Reformed split)
