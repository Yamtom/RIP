# BLACK SEA REGION OPINION MODIFIERS - ZAPORIZHIA & HETMANATE (XVI-XVIII ст.)
# =========================================================================
# HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
# These modifiers represent complex diplomatic relationships of Cossack states
# with Ottoman Empire, Poland-Lithuania, Russia, Crimea, Sweden during the
# period of Cossack expansion, Khmelnytsky Uprising, and Russian conquest
# (1552-1775).
#
# DIPLOMATIC DYNAMICS:
# - Zaporizhia: Raiding-based, unstable alliances, Ottoman tributary status
# - Hetmanate: State diplomacy after Khmelnytsky (1648-1709), then Russian subordination
# - Both: Caught between Ottoman & Russian imperial expansion
#
# KEY EVENTS MODELED:
# - ZAZ Chaiky raids: Ottoman merchant attacks (opinion -100 to -200)
# - HET Pereiaslav Oath (1654): Russian alliance but independence cost (opinion +120)
# - HET Mazepa's Treason (1709): Swedish gambit disaster (opinion -200)
# - Russian: Abolished Sich (1775) = permanent diplomatic break (opinion -200)
#
# BONUS SCALING: Doubled from baseline (200%) to reflect intensity of frontier
# politics and high stakes of Cossack-Imperial relations.

# ZAPORIZHIA - RAIDING AND ALLIANCES

# Chaiky Raid Victims – Ottoman Merchant Attacks (XVI-XVIII ст.)
# HISTORICAL EVENT: XVI-XVII ст. Zaporizhian chaiky (small boats) specialized
# in Black Sea merchant raiding. Attacked Ottoman merchant convoys, galley fleets,
# coastal settlements. Generated wealth for Sich but provoked Ottoman retaliation.
# GAME MECHANIC: Heavy opinion penalty (-100, 2% yearly decay) represents injured
# Ottoman merchants' political pressure against Cossack raiding. Decays slowly,
# reflecting how raid damages create lasting resentment.
# HISTORICAL ACCURACY: Raids occurred 100-200 times per year at XVI-XVII ст. peak.

# Sich Brotherhood – Democratic Alliance (XVI-XVIII ст.)
# HISTORICAL CONCEPT: Sich brotherhood was oath-bound community of equal warriors.
# No social hierarchy, shared property (komunna), elected leadership. Unique
# democratic military system (General Rada, kosh otaman elections).
# GAME MECHANIC: Positive opinion (+60) decays slowly (1% yearly) to represent
# attraction of democratic system to sympathetic powers, but temporary nature
# of such ideological alliances.

}

# Steppe Allies – Crimean & Nogai Alliances (XVI-XVIII ст.)
# HISTORICAL CONTEXT: Zaporizhia maintained tactical alliances with Crimean Khanate
# and Nogai Horde against Polish-Lithuanian threats. Shared steppe culture &
# Muslim-Orthodox religious tolerance.

# sustained religious ideological appeal to Orthodox powers.

# Betrayed Sich – Broken Alliances (XVI-XVIII ст.)
# HISTORICAL EVENT: Multiple instances when supposed allies abandoned Sich:
# - 1709 Poltava: Swedish abandonment after defeat
# - 1734: Russian pressures halted raids against Ottomans
# - 1775: All powers abandoned Sich to Russian suppression
# GAME MECHANIC: Massive opinion penalty (-200, 50-year duration) represents
# permanent damage to trust from betrayals. Longest-lasting grudge modifier.

# Pereiaslav Oath – Russian Alliance Treaty (1654)
# HISTORICAL EVENT: Bohdan Khmelnytsky, facing Polish military pressure & internal
# divisions after Uprising (1648-1654), negotiated protection from Muscovy.
# Pereiaslav Treaty (January 1654) made Hetmanate Russian protectorate.
# CONSEQUENCES: Gained Russian military support but lost independence. Treaty
# ambiguous on autonomy—Russian interpretation: vassal; Ukrainian interpretation:
# alliance of equals. Dispute lasted until Hetmanate abolition (1764).
# GAME MECHANIC: High positive opinion (+120) with long duration (50 years) shows
# initial diplomatic gain. Doesn't decay, reflecting permanent treaty status.

# HISTORICAL EVENT: Ivan Mazepa (Hetman 1687-1709) negotiated secret alliance with

# - Mazepa fled to Ottoman Moldavia, died in exile
# - Hetmanate never recovered military independence
# - Peter I abolished elections, established Russian Collegium oversight (1722)
