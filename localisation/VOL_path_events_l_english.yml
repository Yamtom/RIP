	vol_path_events.1.t:0 "The Future of Ruthenia"
	vol_path_events.1.d:0 "Our nation stands at a crossroads. The question before us is not merely one of governance, but of destiny itself.\n\nSome counselors advocate following the Habsburg model - building a great empire through diplomatic marriages, managing diverse peoples with tolerance, and establishing ourselves as a power broker among the nations. This path promises prestige, alliances, and a multi-ethnic realm held together by dynastic ties.\n\nOthers argue for the Polish-Lithuanian example - strengthening our realm through constitutional reforms, establishing a powerful Sejm, and creating a system where nobility and crown work in concert. This path offers internal stability, cultural flowering, and a unique constitutional framework.\n\nWhich path shall we choose?"
