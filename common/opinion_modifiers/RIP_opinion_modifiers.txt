# BLACK SEA REGION OPINION MODIFIERS - ZAPORIZHIA & HETMANATE (XVI-XVIII ст.)
# =========================================================================
# HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
# These modifiers represent complex diplomatic relationships of Cossack states
# with Ottoman Empire, Poland-Lithuania, Russia, Crimea, Sweden during the
# period of Cossack expansion, Khmelnytsky Uprising, and Russian conquest
# (1552-1775).
#
# DIPLOMATIC DYNAMICS:
# - Zaporizhia: Raiding-based, unstable alliances, Ottoman tributary status
# - Hetmanate: State diplomacy after Khmelnytsky (1648-1709), then Russian subordination
# - Both: Caught between Ottoman & Russian imperial expansion
#
# KEY EVENTS MODELED:
# - ZAZ Chaiky raids: Ottoman merchant attacks (opinion -100 to -200)
# - HET Pereiaslav Oath (1654): Russian alliance but independence cost (opinion +120)
# - HET Mazepa's Treason (1709): Swedish gambit disaster (opinion -200)
# - Russian: Abolished Sich (1775) = permanent diplomatic break (opinion -200)
#
# BONUS SCALING: Doubled from baseline (200%) to reflect intensity of frontier
# politics and high stakes of Cossack-Imperial relations.

# ZAPORIZHIA - RAIDING AND ALLIANCES

# Chaiky Raid Victims – Ottoman Merchant Attacks (XVI-XVIII ст.)
# HISTORICAL EVENT: XVI-XVII ст. Zaporizhian chaiky (small boats) specialized
# in Black Sea merchant raiding. Attacked Ottoman merchant convoys, galley fleets,
# coastal settlements. Generated wealth for Sich but provoked Ottoman retaliation.
# GAME MECHANIC: Heavy opinion penalty (-100, 2% yearly decay) represents injured
# Ottoman merchants' political pressure against Cossack raiding. Decays slowly,
# reflecting how raid damages create lasting resentment.
# HISTORICAL ACCURACY: Raids occurred 100-200 times per year at XVI-XVII ст. peak.

# Sich Brotherhood – Democratic Alliance (XVI-XVIII ст.)
# HISTORICAL CONCEPT: Sich brotherhood was oath-bound community of equal warriors.
# No social hierarchy, shared property (komunna), elected leadership. Unique
# democratic military system (General Rada, kosh otaman elections).
# GAME MECHANIC: Positive opinion (+60) decays slowly (1% yearly) to represent
# attraction of democratic system to sympathetic powers, but temporary nature
# of such ideological alliances.

# Steppe Allies – Crimean & Nogai Alliances (XVI-XVIII ст.)
# HISTORICAL CONTEXT: Zaporizhia maintained tactical alliances with Crimean Khanate

# - 1734: Russian pressures halted raids against Ottomans

# Pereiaslav Oath – Russian Alliance Treaty (1654)
# HISTORICAL EVENT: Bohdan Khmelnytsky, facing Polish military pressure & internal
# divisions after Uprising (1648-1654), negotiated protection from Muscovy.
# Pereiaslav Treaty (January 1654) made Hetmanate Russian protectorate.
# CONSEQUENCES: Gained Russian military support but lost independence. Treaty
# ambiguous on autonomy—Russian interpretation: vassal; Ukrainian interpretation:
# alliance of equals. Dispute lasted until Hetmanate abolition (1764).

# - Mazepa fled to Ottoman Moldavia, died in exile
# - Hetmanate never recovered military independence
# - Peter I abolished elections, established Russian Collegium oversight (1722)

# SVYDRIGAYLO INDEPENDENCE PATH OPINION MODIFIERS (XIV-XV century alternate history)
# =========================================================================
# Historical Context:
# XIV-XV century Ruthenian independence path where Svydrigaylo (Свидригайло) 
# successfully breaks from Lithuania. Subsequent confederation formation affects
# diplomatic relationships with neighboring powers (Poland, Muscovy, Ottoman, Crimea).
#
# Diplomatic Dynamics:
# - Lithuania/Poland: Angry at loss of vassal, threaten military retaliation
# - Muscovy: Suspicious of competing Ruthenian power; eventually absorbs confederation
# - Crimea: Cautiously respects confederation as fellow steppe power
# - Ottoman: Views confederation as useful buffer state
# - Orthodox states (Moldavia, Wallachia): Sympathetic to Ruthenian independence
#
# Key Relationships Modeled:
# - Ruthenian independence accepted (diplomatic resolution)
# - Confederation invitation accepted by ZAZ, HET, CHR, KIE
# - Overlord military threats vs confederation defense
