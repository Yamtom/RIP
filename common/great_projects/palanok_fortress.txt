# PALANOK (MUKACHEVO) FORTRESS – GREAT PROJECT DOSSIER
# =========================================================================
# TECHNICAL OVERVIEW:
# - Province Anchor: start province 1952 (Mukachevo/Maramures) places the
#   monument squarely in Uzhhorod’s heartland. Project type = monument and
#   can_be_moved = no keep it fixed to the volcanic hilltop citadel.
# - Construction Window: build_trigger = is_date 1500.01.01 delays player
#   access until Late Middle Ages, matching historical Habsburg rebuild.
#   Base build cost 1800 ducats with 36-month timer; tiers require owner to
#   accept the province culture (can_upgrade_trigger) reinforcing cultural
#   stewardship of the march.
# - Culture Access: can_use_modifiers_trigger allows Ruthenian, Hungarian,
#   Slovak, or Romanian owners to benefit, reflecting Palanok’s multi-ethnic
#   command history across Upper Hungary and Transylvania.
# - Tier Effects:
#   * Tier 0 (ruined ramparts): instant unlock, small defensiveness + manpower
#     area bonus, -5% fort upkeep nationally.
#   * Tier 1 (renaissance bastion): +20% local defensiveness and friendly
#     movement, manpower doubling, national +5% siege ability to mirror the
#     fortress’ training academies.
#   * Tier 2 (imperial frontier garrison): adds hostile attrition, production
#     boost in Carpathian area, and national fort upkeep/defensiveness stacking.
#   * Tier 3 (Rakoczi citadel apex): heavy attrition (1.5), friendly movement,
#     regiment cost reduction area-wide, national siege +10%, defensiveness +15,
#     prestige tick symbolising Palanok as Carpathian bulwark.
# - Upgrade Costs/Times escalate (1200 -> 3600 -> 9000) mirroring decades of
#   engineering after the 1687 siege; upgrade_time months align with multi-year
#   renovation campaigns.
#
# NARRATIVE/PLOT HOOKS:
# - Fortress of Palanok guarded the salt roads from Solotvyno and served as
#   capital to the Drugeth, later the Rákóczi princes. Mission chains and
#   disasters (Opryshky uprising) tie into its defensive bonuses, letting the
#   player canonise Palanok as keystone of the Carpathian march.
# - Tier progression mirrors historical phases: medieval earthworks -> Italian
#   bastions under Italian engineers -> Habsburg artillery modernisation ->
#   anti-Habsburg stronghold during Rákóczi’s War of Independence.
# - Local manpower boosts echo sheltering of Zakarpattian diets and refugee
#   militias, while national siege bonuses show Palanok’s officer corps training
#   frontier regiments deployed across the monarchy.
