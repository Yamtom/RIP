# ESTATE: NOBLES (Boyars/Starshyna/Magnates; XIV–XIX ст.)
# =========================================================================
#
# HISTORICAL BACKGROUND:
# The Nobility estate in Ukrainian/Ruthenian lands represents the hereditary warrior aristocracy,
# organized into families (clans) with landed estates, private armies, and political authority
# often exceeding that of princes or hetmans. The nobility took multiple forms: (1) old Rurikid
# boyar families with roots in Kyivan Rus'; (2) Polish-style magnates (magnaci) who dominated
# Right Bank after 1569 Lublin Union; (3) Cossack starshyna (officers) who formed a "service
# nobility" in the Hetmanate; (4) Carpathian/Transylvanian nobles (Hungarian, Romanian, Saxon).
# The estate's power derived from land monopoly, judicial authority, military resources, and
# influence over princes/hetmans.
#
# Historical Phases:
# - XIV–XV ст. Boyar Ascendancy: After Kyivan Rus' collapse, boyar families dominated regional
#   principalities (Kyiv, Volyn, Chernihiv, Halych, etc.) as semi-autonomous landowners. Princes
#   ruled through boyar councils (dumas); major decisions required boyar approval; boyars could
#   defect to rival princes. Boyar families controlled castles, armies, and trade routes; wealth
#   came from land, taxes, and control of strategic resources.
# - XVI ст. Polish Magnate Dominance: After 1569 Lublin Union, Right Bank came under Polish Crown.
#   Local (Ruthenian) nobles were absorbed into Polish nobility system; great magnate families
#   (e.g., Ostrogski, Radziwill) accumulated vast estates and private armies; magnates oversaw
#   Orthodox populations as subjects; Church lands often passed to magnate patronage. Magnates
#   competed with each other for crown favor, land grants, and power; Ruthenian nobles could aspire
#   to positions in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth government.
# - XVII ст. Starshyna Emergence: Khmelnytsky's uprising elevated cossack officers (starshyna:
#   generals, koshivyy otaman, judge, chancellor, clerk) into a "new nobility." Starshyna families
#   accumulated estates, populated the Rada, and competed with hetman for supremacy. Unlike Polish
#   magnates (mostly Catholic), starshyna were typically Orthodox and thus embodied the Hetmanate's
#   identity. Starshyna family dynasties (Vyhovskys, Khanenkos, Lyzohubs, etc.) sometimes rivaled
#   hetmans in power and wealth.
# - XVII–XVIII ст. Nobility Consolidation: By 1700, Hetmanate nobility had coalesced into stable
#   families: generals (generali) dominated military; judges controlled courts; chancellors managed
#   administration. Each family accumulated patronage networks, monastery donations, and political
#   followers. Hetman's authority often depended on negotiating with 5–10 great noble houses.
#   Mazepa and successors attempted to subordinate starshyna to hetman by co-opting them into
#   central authority (bureaucracy, Table of Ranks) or by crushing rivals.
# - XVIII ст. Russian Subordination: After Poltava (1709) and especially after abolition of
#   Hetmanate (1764), Russian state subordinated Ukrainian nobility. Peter I's Table of Ranks
#   integrated cossack officers and Ukrainian nobles into Russian nobility hierarchy; noble status
#   became conditional on state service; land ownership became subject to state approval. Catherine II
#   further consolidated control by granting Russian nobility vast Ukrainian estates (given to
#   favorites, favorites, etc.); Ukrainian nobles who accepted Russian service were given ranks and
#   estates; those who resisted were sidelined. By 1800, Ukrainian nobility was thoroughly Russified
#   and subordinated to St. Petersburg.
#
# Nobility Estate Structure:
# - Great Magnate Houses (Правобереж): Families like Ostrogski, Wiśniewski, Sapieha controlled
#   kingdoms of land, armies, and fortifications; had diplomatic relationships; could influence
#   crown policy. Typically Catholic, allied with Polish Crown.
# - Ruthenian Boyar Families (Лівобереж): Families like Khmel'nyts'ky, Doroshenko, Samoylovych,
#   Vyhovsky maintained hereditary titles, estates, and armies; older Kyivan Rus' provenance;
#   typically Orthodox; semi-autonomous under overlord (Poland or later Hetman).
# - Starshyna Oligarchs (Гетьманщина XVII–XVIII вв.): Officers who became hereditary noble families
#   (Mazepa, Rozumovs'ky, Khanenko, Lyzohub, Holub, Semenovych); controlled regiments, armies, and
#   vast estates; competed directly with hetman; often nominated hetman successors.
# - Galician/Carpathian Nobility: Hungarian, Saxon, Polish, and Ruthenian nobles in Galicia,
#   Carpathian foothills, and Transylvania; complicated ethnic/religious identities; often competed
#   with Ottoman and Hungarian suzerainty; eventually integrated into Austro-Hungarian nobility (post-1772).
#
# Nobility Estate Interests & Agendas (Game Representation):
# - Political Supremacy: Nobles desire to dominate state decisions, especially regarding war,
#   taxation, and land distribution. They oppose centralization (which reduces their autonomy) and
#   demand "magnate democracy" (oligarchic rule by great houses).
# - Land Monopoly & Serfdom: Nobles defend their monopoly on land ownership and their right to
#   enserfed peasants. They oppose peasant freedoms, cossack settlement on "noble lands," and state
#   redistribution of property.
# - Tax Exemptions & Privileges: Nobles demand exemption from taxes/levies, monopolies on lucrative
#   trades (salt, fur, timber), and administrative positions for their family members.
# - Military Authority: Nobles command private armies and demand right to wage private wars (feuds),
#   to discipline subjects without state interference, and to monopolize military office (generals,
#   officers).
# - Judicial Authority: Nobles demand right to administer justice in their territories (without
#   appeal to crown courts), to try and execute subjects, and to settle disputes among themselves
#   outside state authority.
#
# Nobility Privilege Mechanics (In-Game):
# - Happy/Loyal Nobles: +manpower recovery speed +20%, -land maintenance modifier -10%, +monthly
#   support heir gain +10%, +royalist revolutionary support +20%. Happy nobles provide soldiers,
#   reduced military costs, and political stability.
# - Neutral Nobles: +manpower recovery speed +20%, +royalist support +10%. Baseline military
#   production and stability support.
# - Angry Nobles: -manpower recovery speed -10%, +land maintenance modifier +10%, -monthly support
#   heir gain -20%, +global unrest +2, -royalist support -10%. Angry nobles can foment civil war,
#   refuse military service, and destabilize succession.
#
# Nobility-Starshyna Conflict (Game Design Note):
# A central tension in Hetmanate history is the competition between hereditary magnate nobility
# (Polish, older Boyar families) and the "service nobility" of starshyna officers. In game terms,
# this suggests that CHR, HET, and KIE should have active Nobility estate competition; the hetman
# must negotiate with both magnate families (representing old Kyivan/Polish interests) and starshyna
# (representing cossack meritocracy). Privileges that favor one faction may anger the other.
#
# GAME MECHANICS (Design Notes):
# The Nobility estate generates influence from land ownership (noble estates), from manpower
# production (peasant levies from noble lands), and from military size (private armies). Nobility
# can trigger disasters (noble rebellions, feudal wars, coup d'état attempts) if loyalty drops;
# it can demand privileges (tax exemptions, land expansion, military authority) that conflict
# with centralization and state building. For CHR, HET: Nobility is a major estate with veto power
# (starshyna dominate politics; hereditary magnate families own vast territories). For KRU, KIE:
# Nobility is less dominant but still important (old Boyar families, some magnate influence from
# Poland). For ZAZ: Nobility is weaker (cossack meritocracy and democracy dominate; hereditary
# nobles rare).
