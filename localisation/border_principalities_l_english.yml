 # Border Principalities Events
 border_principalities.1.t: "The Shemyaka Heirs in Rylsk"
 border_principalities.1.d: "After the failure of Dmitri Shemyaka to secure the throne of Muscovy, his descendants were granted the principality of Rylsk by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. As Rurikid princes with legitimate claims to Russian lands, they represent both a valuable asset and a potential liability. Their presence on the border could serve as a buffer against Muscovite expansion, but it also attracts the attention of Moscow's ambitious rulers who may see them as pretenders to be liberated."
 border_principalities.1.a: "Grant them autonomous rule as our vassals"
 border_principalities.1.b: "We shall rule Rylsk directly"
 
 border_principalities.2.t: "The Glinski Princes and Their Tatars"
 border_principalities.2.d: "The Glinski family claims descent from the mighty Mamai, the Mongol general who once dominated the steppes. They have petitioned for lands in our eastern borderlands, offering to settle Tatar cavalry in exchange for defending us against raids from the wild steppes. These Tatars, though of the same stock as our enemies, have proven loyal to the Glinski princes and could provide valuable military service. However, granting such power to a family claiming descent from our former oppressors may be controversial."
 border_principalities.2.a: "Grant them lands and welcome their Tatar warriors"
 border_principalities.2.b: "We need no Tatar cavalry in our service"
 
 border_principalities.3.t: "Jagoldai's Golden Horde Remnant"
 border_principalities.3.d: "Jagoldai, a pretender to the throne of the Golden Horde, has offered to settle his followers in the lands south of Kursk in exchange for our protection. His Tatar cavalry would serve as a formidable buffer against raids from the steppes, and his claim to Golden Horde legitimacy could prove useful in future dealings with the successor khanates. However, allowing a horde to settle so close to our heartlands is not without risk."
 border_principalities.3.a: "Accept Jagoldai and his warriors"
 border_principalities.3.b: "We need no horde vassals"
 
 border_principalities.4.t: "Rylsk Considers Muscovite Protection"
 border_principalities.4.d: "The princes of Rylsk, descendants of Dmitri Shemyaka, have been approached by Muscovite agents who remind them of their Rurikid heritage and claim to the Russian lands. Moscow offers them estates deep in Muscovite territory and recognition of their noble status if they acknowledge the Grand Prince as their rightful sovereign. We face a choice: strengthen our hold on Rylsk through concessions, allow them to depart peacefully, or risk war with Muscovy to keep them by force."
 border_principalities.4.a: "Grant them privileges to keep them loyal"
 border_principalities.4.b: "Let them go peacefully to Moscow"
 border_principalities.4.c: "They are our subjects! This means war!"
 
 border_principalities.5.t: "The Princes of Rylsk Seek Our Protection"
 border_principalities.5.d: "The Rurikid princes of Rylsk, descendants of Dmitri Shemyaka, have renounced their allegiance to Lithuania and ask to enter our service. They bring with them legitimate claims to lands on the Lithuanian border and valuable knowledge of our enemy's defenses. Their defection provides both military advantage and diplomatic justification for future campaigns against the Grand Duchy."
 border_principalities.5.a: "Welcome them as faithful subjects of the rightful Rus'"
 
 border_principalities.6.t: "The Glinski Rebellion Brewing"
 border_principalities.6.d: "Tensions between the Glinski princes and our court have reached a breaking point. The proud descendants of Mamai feel slighted by our treatment and have been approached by Muscovite agents promising greater honors and estates. Their control over substantial Tatar cavalry forces makes them dangerous enemies. We must decide whether to appease them with gold and privileges, suppress them with military force, or allow them to depart to Moscow."
 border_principalities.6.a: "Negotiate and grant them concessions"
 border_principalities.6.b: "Mobilize forces to suppress any rebellion"
 border_principalities.6.c: "Exile the troublesome family"
 
 border_principalities.7.t: "The Glinski Rebellion Erupts"
 border_principalities.7.d: "Our attempts to placate the Glinski princes have failed. They have raised their Tatar cavalry in open rebellion and declared their allegiance to Muscovy! Their intimate knowledge of our border defenses makes them particularly dangerous, and Moscow will surely use this opportunity to press claims against our eastern provinces."
 border_principalities.7.a: "So be it, we shall face them in battle"
 
 border_principalities.8.t: "The Glinski Princes Enter Our Service"
 border_principalities.8.d: "The powerful Glinski family, descendants of the legendary Mamai and commanders of formidable Tatar cavalry, have abandoned Lithuania and entered our service. They bring with them valuable military expertise, knowledge of Lithuanian defenses, and loyal Tatar warriors. Their defection is a significant blow to Lithuania and provides us with capable commanders for our campaigns. One of their descendants, Elena Glinskaya, will eventually become the mother of our future ruler."
 border_principalities.8.a: "Welcome them with all honors due to their station"
 
 border_principalities.9.t: "Jagoldai's Horde Wavers in Loyalty"
 border_principalities.9.d: "The Jagoldai Tatars, who have served as our border buffer for years, are being courted by Muscovite diplomats. Moscow offers them better lands and greater autonomy under Muscovite protection. As steppe nomads, they have little attachment to any overlord beyond practical considerations of safety and prosperity. We must decide whether to increase payments to retain their loyalty, allow them to depart peacefully, or risk war to keep them under our authority."
 border_principalities.9.a: "Increase their tribute to keep them loyal"
 border_principalities.9.b: "Let them seek their fortune with Moscow"
 border_principalities.9.c: "They are bound to us by oath! War if necessary!"
 
 border_principalities.10.t: "Jagoldai's Tatars Seek Our Protection"
 border_principalities.10.d: "The Jagoldai Tatars, led by descendants of Golden Horde nobility, have broken with Lithuania and pledged themselves to our service. Their fierce cavalry will strengthen our borders against raids from the south, and their settlement provides us with a forward military presence on the steppe frontier. This defection further weakens Lithuania's hold on the borderlands."
 border_principalities.10.a: "Welcome them as faithful servants of the Tsar"
 
 border_principalities.11.t: "The Severian Princes Consider Moscow"
 border_principalities.11.d: "The princes of Starodub and other Severian lands, who have long chafed under Lithuanian rule, are being courted by Moscow. These Orthodox Rus' princes see themselves as having more in common with their fellow Russians than with Catholic Lithuania. They have approached Muscovite officials about switching their allegiance, offering their territories in exchange for estates and recognition. This could spark the war that has been brewing for years."
 border_principalities.11.a: "We will not surrender Severia without a fight"
 border_principalities.11.b: "Let the Severian princes go to Moscow"
 
 border_principalities.12.t: "The Severian Princes Offer Their Lands"
 border_principalities.12.d: "The Orthodox princes of the Severian lands have renounced Lithuanian overlordship and pledged themselves to us as the rightful rulers of all Rus'. They bring with them strategic territories on Lithuania's eastern border and provide moral justification for our expansion westward. This defection represents a significant victory in our long struggle to reunify the Russian lands under one sovereign."
 border_principalities.12.a: "Accept them as brothers in the great gathering of Russian lands"
