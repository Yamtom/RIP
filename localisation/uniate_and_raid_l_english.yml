 # UNIATE CHURCH EVENTS

 uniate_church.1.t:0 "Proposal for Church Union"
 uniate_church.1.d:0 "The Catholic Church has approached our Orthodox hierarchy with a proposal for union. Rome promises to preserve Orthodox rites and liturgy while recognizing papal supremacy. This could ease tensions with Catholic powers and provide access to Catholic educational networks, but many Orthodox faithful view this as betrayal of true faith."
 uniate_church.1.a:0 "Accept the Union of Brest"
 uniate_church.1.b:0 "Reject the Union proposal"
 uniate_church.1.c:0 "Negotiate limited communion"
 
 uniate_church.2.t:0 "The Union of Brest"
 uniate_church.2.d:0 "In 1596, Metropolitan Rahoza and several bishops signed the Union of Brest, creating the Uniate Church. While preserving Eastern rite, the Uniates now recognize papal authority. This historic compromise aims to bridge Catholic and Orthodox worlds, though many Orthodox faithful resist this change."
 uniate_church.2.a:0 "A new era begins"
 
 uniate_church.3.t:0 "Orthodox Brotherhood Resistance"
 uniate_church.3.d:0 "Orthodox brotherhoods in our cities are mobilizing against the Uniate Church. These lay organizations, traditionally defenders of Orthodox faith and education, view the union as Latin infiltration. They demand protection of Orthodox hierarchy and institutions."
 uniate_church.3.a:0 "Support the Orthodox resistance"
 uniate_church.3.b:0 "Enforce the Union"
 uniate_church.3.c:0 "Permit both churches to coexist"
 
 uniate_church.4.t:0 "Cossacks Defend Orthodoxy"
 uniate_church.4.d:0 "The Cossacks have declared themselves defenders of Orthodox faith against the Uniate Church. For the Zaporozhian Host, Orthodox identity is inseparable from Cossack freedom. They threaten rebellion if we force the Union upon them."
 uniate_church.4.a:0 "Grant Cossacks Orthodox autonomy"
 uniate_church.4.b:0 "Suppress Cossack resistance"
 uniate_church.4.c:0 "Negotiate compromise"
 
 uniate_church.5.t:0 "Synod of Zamość"
 uniate_church.5.d:0 "The Synod of Zamość (1720) seeks to reform the Uniate Church according to Latin practices. This Latinization threatens to erase the Eastern character that made the Union attractive. Will we preserve Orthodox traditions or accelerate integration with Rome?"
 uniate_church.5.a:0 "Latinize the Uniate Church"
 uniate_church.5.b:0 "Preserve Eastern traditions"
 
 uniate_church.6.t:0 "Uniate Educational Network"

 uniate_church.6.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 uniate_church.7.t:0 "Uniate Cultural Flowering"
 uniate_church.7.d:0 "The Uniate Church has become a patron of arts and scholarship. Basilican monasteries preserve manuscripts, commission icons in traditional style, and support printing presses publishing in Church Slavonic. This cultural synthesis enriches our realm."
 uniate_church.7.a:0 "A golden age of culture"
 
 uniate_church.8.t:0 "Moscow's Anti-Union Campaign"
 uniate_church.8.d:0 "The Muscovite Patriarch has launched a propaganda campaign against the Uniate Church, calling it 'false Orthodoxy' and 'Latin heresy.' Moscow positions itself as defender of true Orthodox faith, seeking to undermine our religious policies."
 uniate_church.8.a:0 "Defend the Union"
 uniate_church.8.b:0 "Distance ourselves from Rome"
