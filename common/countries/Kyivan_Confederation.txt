# KYIVAN CONFEDERATION (КРУ / KRU)
# Alternate History: Ruthenian Independence Path XIV-XIX century
#
# ===========================================================================
# HISTORICAL BACKGROUND (ALTERNATE TIMELINE)
# ===========================================================================
#
# THE SVYDRIGAYLO INDEPENDENCE PATH (XIV-XV century):
# 
# In our alternate history, Svydrigaylo (Свидригайло, son of Olgerd/Ольгерда),
# Lithuanian prince with Ruthenian heritage, successfully establishes an
# independent Ruthenian state in the early XV century. Rather than being
# subordinated to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (as happened historically),
# Svydrigaylo creates a confederation model uniting:
#
# - KYIV: Religious & commercial center (Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, metropolitan)
# - HETMANATE (HET): Military power (cavalry, regimental structure)
# - ZAPORIZHIA (ZAZ): Democratic military frontier (Cossack Sich, cavalry raids)
# - CHERNIHIV (CHR): Administrative eastern center (Lívoberezhnia coordination)
#
# CONFEDERATION PRINCIPLES (XV-XIX centuries):
# - Federated governance: Multiple centers of power with shared sovereignty
# - Balanced legitimacy: Hetman's oligarchic authority + Sich's republican tradition
# - Orthodox church unity: Kyiv metropolitan as spiritual authority
# - Cossack autonomy: Zaporizhian democracy preserved as military frontier
# - Mercantile network: Dnieper commerce + Black Sea trade routes
#
# ===========================================================================
# POLITICAL STRUCTURE (CONFEDERATION MODEL)
# ===========================================================================
#
# The KRU Confederation operates as a federal state with three power centers:
#
# 1. KYIVAN CENTER (Kyiv Proper)
#    - Orthodox metropolitan authority
#    - Ecclesiastical governance
#    - Commercial hub on Dnieper
#    - Cultural/educational institutions
#
# 2. HETMANATE OLIGARCHY (Chernihiv-Poltava Region)
#    - Hetman as military commander
#    - Starshyna (officer council) governance
#    - Regimental administration (polkovo-sotennyi system)
#    - Left Bank consolidated administrative power
#
# 3. ZAPORIZHIAN DEMOCRACY (Steppe Frontier)
#    - Sich Rada (assembly of cossacks)
#    - Kosh Otaman (elected military leader)
#    - Chaiky flotilla operations
#    - Steppe military autonomy
#
# BALANCING MECHANISM:
# - Hetman handles state diplomacy & regular army
# - Zaporizhia controls frontier raids & sea operations
# - Kyiv maintains religious/ecclesiastical affairs
# - Confederation council (representatives from all three) makes major decisions
#
# ===========================================================================
# GOVERNMENT FORM: CONFEDERAL OLIGARCHY (Elective Monarchy variant)
# ===========================================================================
#
# The confederation employs an elected hetman system with starshyna council
# oversight. This hybrid government balances:
# 
# - LEGITIMACY: Hetman's authority + hereditary noble privileges
# - REPUBLICAN TRADITION: Cossack democracy + assembly voting
# - ABSOLUTISM: Limited by federal structure & church authority
#
# Key government concepts:
# - Hetman elected by starshyna council + cossack assembly
# - Term limits or life tenure depending on circumstances
# - Veto powers held by Kyiv metropolitan on religious matters
# - Zaporizhian Sich retains military autonomy (cannot be overruled)
# - Confederation parliament meets yearly to approve state budget
#
# ===========================================================================
# MILITARY SYSTEM
# ===========================================================================
#
# The confederation's military combines three distinct traditions:
#
# 1. KYIVAN CITY MILITIA
#    - Urban garrison forces
#    - Defensive/garrison troops
#    - Trained from merchant class
#    - Morale boost: +5% from urban defense tradition
#
# 2. HETMANATE CAVALRY (Regimental System)
#    - Polkovo-Sotennyi organization (15 regiments in golden age)
#    - Heavy cavalry + light cavalry mix
#    - Officer corps educated at Kyiv-Mohyla
#    - Morale boost: +15% from officer excellence
#    - Recruitment: Cossack muster rolls + noble conscription
#
# 3. ZAPORIZHIAN MOBILE FORCES
#    - Cavalry specialists (husaria-influenced)
#    - Light cavalry for raiding
#    - River flotilla (chaiky boats)
#    - Morale boost: +20% from free warrior tradition
#    - Recruitment: Volunteer basin, not conscription
#
# LOGISTICS:
# - Supply bases: Kyiv, Poltava, Batuuryn, Zaporizhia
# - Grain belt: Chernozem agricultural surplus
# - Cossack slobodas: Military settlements for quick mobilization
# - Cavalry strength: 200% bonus (reflects steppe warfare specialization)
#
# ===========================================================================
# ECONOMY
# ===========================================================================
#
# The confederation's economy centers on:
#
# 1. GRAIN EXPORT
#    - Chernozem wheat from Poltava, Sumy, northern regions
#    - Dnieper transport routes to Black Sea
#    - Export to Western Europe (Poland, Brandenburg, Netherlands)
#    - Tax efficiency: +20% from grain monopoly
#
# 2. SALT TRADE
#    - Solotvyno salt deposits (Carpathian region)
#    - Internal consumption + export to Poland
#    - Competition with Crimean sources
#    - Trade power: +15% from salt production
#
# 3. DNIEPER COMMERCE
#    - Constantinople (Orthodox pilgrimage goods)
#    - Ottoman Empire (Black Sea trade)
#    - Baltic ports (grain, furs, amber)
#    - Merchant node: Kyiv as trade hub
#
# 4. COSSACK TRIBUTE SYSTEM
#    - Chaiky raids on Ottoman caravans (unofficial income)
#    - Ottoman "peace payments" to avoid attacks
#    - Crimean trade agreements
#    - Diplomatic revenue from neighboring states
#
# TAXATION:
# - Overall tax efficiency: +15% from confederal administration
# - Provincial variance: Kyiv highest (urban commerce), Zaporizhia lowest (military autonomy)
# - Estate management: Noble, clergy, merchant, & cossack estates
#
# ===========================================================================
# CULTURAL IDENTITY (XV-XIX centuries)
# ===========================================================================

#
# HISTORICAL MEMORY:
# - Kyivan Rus' succession claim (IX-XIII century heritage)
# - Cossack freedom tradition
# - Orthodox ecclesiastical authority
# - Anti-absolutist, confederal governance model
#
# ===========================================================================
# DIPLOMACY & FOREIGN RELATIONS (XV-XIX centuries)
# ===========================================================================
#
# The confederation maintains a delicate balance between major powers:
#
# OTTOMAN EMPIRE (Favorable):
# - Accepts KRU confederation as buffer against Russian expansion
# - Tolerates Chaiky raids on Ottoman merchants (accepted cost of peace)
# - Trade agreements on Black Sea routes
# - Diplomatic opinion bonus: +75 (mutual interest in status quo)
# - Risk: Ottoman decline (XVII-XVIII) reduces protection
#
# CRIMEAN KHANATE (Favorable):
# - Shared steppe interests & occasional alliances
# - Trade agreements on Dnieper-Black Sea routes
# - Mutual raids against common enemies (Poland, Russia)
# - Diplomatic opinion bonus: +50
# - Risk: Crimea subordinated to Ottoman then Russia
#
# POLAND-LITHUANIA (Complicated):
# - Initially hostile (loss of vassal)
# - Later attempts at reconciliation (Hadiach Union precedent)
# - Shared Orthodox/Catholic religious duality
# - Diplomatic opinion: 0 to +50 depending on circumstances
# - Risk: Polish military pressure (XVI-XVII centuries)
#
# MUSCOVY/RUSSIA (Hostile):
# - Views confederation as rival Ruthenian power
# - Eventually (XVIII century) absorbs confederation through military conquest
# - Ideological competition: "Third Rome" vs Kyivan Rus' succession
# - Diplomatic opinion: -100 (fundamental conflict)
# - Risk: Russian expansion inevitable (historical trajectory)
#
# MOLDAVIA & WALLACHIA (Friendly):
# - Orthodox neighbors with anti-Ottoman sympathies
# - Trade agreements on Danube routes
# - Diplomatic opinion bonus: +40
# - Cultural/religious affinity
#
# NOBLE FAMILIES & STARSHYNA CLANS:
# - Key diplomatic players: Lyzohub, Apostol, Razumovskiy, Vyshnevskyy clans
# - Internal diplomacy: Managing competing starshyna factions
# - Marriage alliances: Strategic marriages with Polish, Moldavian, even Ottoman nobility
#
# ===========================================================================
# HISTORICAL EVENTS & CRISES (XV-XIX centuries)
# ===========================================================================
#
# MAJOR TURNING POINTS:
#
# 1. CONSOLIDATION (XV century):
#    - Svydrigaylo declares independence from Lithuania
#    - Zaporizhia joins confederation
#    - Kyivan metropolitan establishes ecclesiastical authority
#    - Chernihiv integrated as left-bank administrative center
#
# 2. EXPANSION ERA (XVI century):
#    - Territorial consolidation under early hetmans
#    - Chaiky raids expand into Ottoman territory
#    - Cossack population growth
#    - Conflict with Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth

#    - Anti-Polish rebellion unites cossacks
#    - Pereiaslav Oath (1654) ties confederation to Russia
#    - Orthodox church reaffirms authority
#
# 4. MAZEPA ERA (1687-1709):
#    - Ivan Mazepa modernizes hetmanate
#    - Cultural renaissance (Kyiv-Mohyla expansion)
#    - Mazepa's Swedish gambit (1709) fails, reduces confederation power
#    - Russian control increases post-Poltava
#
# 5. SLOW DECLINE (1709-1775):
#    - Russian interference in hetman elections
#    - Loss of left-bank autonomy
#    - Zaporizhia increasingly marginalized
#    - 1775: Destruction of Sich by Russian empire
#    - Confederation effectively absorbed into Russian empire
#
# ===========================================================================
# ALTERNATE HISTORY VARIATIONS
# ===========================================================================
#
# STRONG CONFEDERATION PATH (player-controlled):
# - Maintain balance between three power centers
# - Ally with Ottoman/Crimea against Russian expansion
# - Preserve Zaporizhian autonomy
# - Resist Russian cultural assimilation
# - Outcome: Independent confederation survives into XIX century
#
# HETMANATE ASCENDANT PATH:
# - Hetman centralizes power
# - Starshyna oligarchy controls state
# - Kyivan church becomes subordinate
# - Zaporizhia forced to submit
# - Outcome: Confederation becomes hereditary hetmanate (closer to Russian control)
#
# COSSACK DEMOCRACY PATH:
# - Zaporizhia expands influence
# - Republican tradition rises
# - Hetman elected annually
# - Kyivan-Hetmanate tensions
# - Outcome: Confederation becomes radicalized, more unstable
#
# ===========================================================================
# MECHANICAL NOTES (EUIV GAMEPLAY)
# ===========================================================================
#
# Government Form: Elective Monarchy (Confederal Oligarchy)
# - Government tier: Monarchy
# - Succession type: Elective (hetman chosen by council)
# - Voting body: Starshyna council + Cossack assembly representatives
# - Legitimacy accumulation: +2/year (high authority)
# - Republican tradition: Can reach 100 (democratic Zaporizhia influence)
