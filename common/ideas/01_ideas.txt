# UZHHOROD (UZH) NATIONAL IDEAS – TECHNICAL & NARRATIVE BRIEFING
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# STRUCTURE:
# - Start bonuses (infantry_power +10%, hostile_attrition +0.5) grant early
#   Carpathian mountain edge, synergising with march-style mission rewards and
#   the Palanok fortress great project.
# - Idea order complements mission tree pacing: defensive economy (Smereka,
#   Carpathian Fort), legal-modernisation (Laws), pluralism (Mountain Faith),
#   trade/roads for Danubian expansion. Bonus grants +1 free leader to support
#   multi-front policing.
#
# ITEMISED IDEAS:
# * UZH_smereka: attrition reduction + movement speed mirrors spruce forests
#   (smereka) allowing light infantry to traverse passes. Reduces attrition on
#   own troops while missions/monuments raise hostile attrition.
# * UZH_bartka: discipline + morale references the Lemko bartka axe as both
#   weapon and symbol; boosts front-line efficiency.
# * UZH_carpathian_fort: defensiveness + fort upkeep reduction aligns with
#   Palanok/Komitat missions; stacks with great project modifiers.
# * UZH_laws: tax + development cost reduction captures Magdeburg-inspired
#   municipal reforms; feeds economic branches of mission tree.
# * UZH_mountain_faith: universal tolerance fosters identity-branch missions
#   (Ruthenian/Rusyn/Uhro-Rusyn) and supports Union Synod reform.
# * UZH_free_trade: trade power + goods size depict Huszt as salt-caravan hub
#   linking Tokaj wine trade and Solotvyno salt.
# * UZH_roads: extra diplo upkeep + improve relations accelerate Danubian
#   diplomacy (Pressburg Compact, Carpathian Federation missions).
