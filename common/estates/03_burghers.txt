# ESTATE: BURGHERS (Urban Merchants, Craftsmen, Townspeople; XIV–XIX ??.)
# =========================================================================
#
# HISTORICAL BACKGROUND:
# The Burgher estate in Ukrainian/Ruthenian lands represents urban merchants, craftsmen, and
# townspeople organized into guilds, city councils (magistrats), and town charters. Burghers held
# special privileges (tax exemptions, trade monopolies, self-governance in municipalities) granted
# by princes/magnates in exchange for taxes and loyalty. However, burghers remained subordinate to
# nobility; they could not own agricultural land (reserved for nobles), could not hold high military
# office, and were vulnerable to noble confiscation and abuse. Urban centers (Kyiv, Lviv, Chernihiv,
# Lutsk, Kamianets, Zamosc) became loci of competition between burgher autonomy and noble domination.
#
# Historical Phases:
# - XIV–XV ??. Chartered Towns: Princes/magnates granted town charters (magdeburg rights, Hanseatic
#   privileges) to encourage urban settlement and commerce. Towns like Lviv, Kamianets, and Lutsk
#   received rights to elect magistrates (burgomaster, council), regulate trade, and control market
#   taxes. Craftsmen organized into guilds (stonemasons, blacksmiths, tailors, etc.) that controlled
#   production and apprenticeship. However, towns remained under noble military authority; lords
#   could levy soldiers, confiscate goods, or annul privileges.
# - XVI ??. Golden Age of Trade: Polish expansion and Reformation brought merchants from Germany,
#   Italy, and Armenia into Ukrainian towns; new trade goods (spices, cloth, metals) flowed along
#   routes from Black Sea to Baltic. Towns prospered; burghers accumulated capital, built civic
#   monuments, and gained cultural influence. Guild halls became centers of urban power; city
#   councils negotiated with magnates for expanded privileges. However, privilege remained conditional:
#   burghers could be crushed by magnate violence (e.g., during Khmelnytsky war, many Jewish and
#   Christian merchants were massacred or enslaved).
# - XVII ??. Khmelnytsky War Impact: Urban centers were devastated; merchant networks disrupted;
#   populations fled. Recovery was slow. Those burghers who survived often collaborated with
#   Hetmanate (paying taxes, providing supplies) and gained some security. However, hetman authority
#   was always contingent; starshyna could still confiscate goods or pressure merchants for loans.
# - XVII–XVIII ??. Hetmanate & Commonwealth Period: Urban life partially recovered. Kyiv, Chernihiv,
#   and other cities repopulated; merchants rebuilt networks; guilds reformed. However, burghers
#   faced constant pressure from multiple overlords: hetman demanded taxes and supplies for military;
#   nobles demanded tribute and labor service; Church demanded tithes and special privileges. City
#   councils attempted to maintain autonomy through appeals to charter rights and through negotiation
#   with competing powers. Some towns (e.g., Lviv) became centers of religious/cultural conflict
#   (Orthodox vs. Uniate vs. Catholic vs. Armenian) reflected in burgher politics.
# - XVIII ??. Russian Subordination: After Russian takeover of Left Bank (post-1709) and especially
#   after abolition of Hetmanate (1764), Russian state subordinated burghers to centralized authority.
#   City magistrates were appointed by Russian governors; guild privileges were curtailed; merchants
#   had to pay Russian taxes and comply with Russian trade regulations. Burghers lost de facto
#   autonomy; cities became administrative subdivisions of provincial Russian hierarchy.
# - XIX ??. Industrial Decline: Ukrainian towns were integrated into Russian imperial economy but
#   remained economically subordinate to western/central European centers (Lviv, Warsaw, etc.);
#   urban development stagnated; merchant class was co-opted into Russian bureaucracy or remained
#   as small-scale traders/craftsmen.
#
# Burgher Estate Structure:
# - Magistrate (City Council): Elected burgomaster, aldermen, and councilmen; administered city
#   charter; negotiated with prince/hetman; controlled city finances and market regulations.
# - Guilds: Craftsmen organized by trade (stonemasons, blacksmiths, tailors, bakers, etc.); controlled
#   production quality, apprenticeship, and trade monopolies; guild masters held authority over
#   journeymen and apprentices; guild hall was community meeting place.
# - Merchant Guilds: Larger commercial organizations (spice merchants, cloth merchants, metal
#   merchants, etc.); monopolized long-distance trade; established trading posts in other cities;
#   negotiated privileges with magnates and foreign rulers.
# - Jewish Merchants (Kahal): In many towns, Jewish merchants formed parallel authority structures
#   (kahal, rabbi councils) with semi-autonomous rights; focused on moneylending, commerce, and
#   communal self-governance; often politically allied with city magistrate against noble pressure,
#   but also vulnerable to anti-Semitic violence when nobles needed scapegoats (e.g., Khmelnytsky era).
# - Burgher Nobility (Patriciate): Wealthiest merchant families who accumulated land, titles, and
#   political authority; could aspire to minor noble status through intermarriage or royal favor;
#   often formed oligarchic councils that monopolized magistrate positions.
#
# Burgher Estate Interests & Agendas (Game Representation):
# - Trade Monopolies & Tax Exemptions: Burghers demand monopolies on specific goods (salt, spices,
#   alcohol, furs), exemptions from taxes and tolls, and the right to set market prices without
#   noble interference.
# - Urban Autonomy & Self-Governance: Burghers demand right to elect magistrates, control city
#   finances, regulate guilds, and administer justice within city walls without appeal to noble courts.
# - Legal Protection: Burghers demand protection from noble violence, arbitrary confiscation, and
#   arbitrary conscription. They invoke charter rights and propose written legal codes (city statutes)
#   as defense against arbitrary rule.
# - Cultural & Religious Freedom: Burghers (especially in diverse cities like Lviv, Kamianets, Kyiv)
#   demand freedom to worship according to their faith (Catholic, Orthodox, Uniate, Jewish, etc.),
#   to maintain separate religious communities, and to resist forced conversion or discrimination.
# - Labor Supply & Apprenticeship: Burghers demand control over labor migration, apprenticeship
#   training, and guild membership; they oppose competition from rural craftsmen and foreign merchants.
#
# Burgher Privilege Mechanics (In-Game):
# - Happy/Loyal Burghers: +trade goods produced +20%, +trade efficiency +15%, -merchant republic
#   trigger / +merchant republic loyalty +10%, +governing capacity +100, +prestige +10 yearly.
#   Happy burghers generate wealth, manage trade efficiently, and provide administrative capacity.
# - Neutral Burghers: +trade goods produced +10%, +trade efficiency +10%. Baseline economic production.
# - Angry Burghers: -trade goods produced -10%, -trade efficiency -15%, +global unrest +2, -prestige
#   -10 yearly. Angry burghers can foment urban riots, refuse to pay taxes, and undermine prestige.
#
# Burgher Estate as Economic Counterweight:
# In game terms, burghers represent the merchant/commercial power that could challenge noble
# land monopoly and hetman military authority. Happy burghers generate the wealth needed to pay
# armies, build fortifications, and fund diplomacy; angry burghers can economically strangle the
# state. This suggests that CHR, HET, and especially trading cities (KIE, Lviv, Kamianets) should
# carefully balance burgher demands with other estates.
#
# GAME MECHANICS (Design Notes):
# The Burgher estate generates influence from urban provinces (cities with high development),
# from trade goods produced, and from trade route control. Burghers can trigger disasters (urban
# riots, merchant strikes, economic collapse) if loyalty drops; they can demand privileges (trade
# monopolies, tax exemptions, urban autonomy) that conflict with state centralization and noble
# land monopoly. For cities with significant trade (Kyiv, Lviv, Kamianets): Burghers are economically
# important and can demand significant power. For agricultural/military regions (CHR, HET, ZAZ):
# Burghers are weaker but still important for supplying army and funding state.
