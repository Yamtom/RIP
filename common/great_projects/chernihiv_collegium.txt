# Chernihiv Collegium – Mechanics, Narrative, References
# Mechanics: Monument unlocked in 1650 that accelerates institution spread, missionary
# strength, development discounts, and late-tier tech/idea cost reductions while adding
# reform progress—ideal for an administrative Chernihiv run.
# Narrative: Evokes the Mohyla Academy offshoot that trained clergy and officers for
# the Hetmanate through the 18th century.
# References: Larry Wolff, *The Idea of Galicia* (2010); Frank Sysyn, essays on Lazar Baranovych; Ihor Shevchenko,
# *The Ukrainian Baroque* (1971).
