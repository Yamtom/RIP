 zaz_fixes.1.t: "Founding the Enhanced Sich"
 zaz_fixes.1.d: "The Zaporozhian Sich must be more than just a military camp—it must be an impregnable fortress that can withstand both Ottoman and Tatar assaults. Our master builder Dmytro Vyshnevetsky proposes constructing stone fortifications and establishing permanent democratic institutions within the Sich. This will transform our settlement into the heart of Cossack democracy and military power."
 zaz_fixes.1.a: "Build the fortress and strengthen our democracy!"
 zaz_fixes.1.b: "The traditional Sich is sufficient."
 
 zaz_fixes.2.t: "Black Sea Raiding Rights"
 zaz_fixes.2.d: "Our Chaiky boats have been raiding Ottoman coastal towns and merchant ships for years, bringing wealth and glory to the Sich. The Ottoman Sultan now sends envoys proposing a treaty: we may raid designated zones in exchange for ceasing attacks on major ports. Should we accept this limitation, or continue our unrestricted raids?"
 zaz_fixes.2.a: "Negotiate zones—pragmatism ensures survival."
 zaz_fixes.2.b: "We raid where we please! The Black Sea is ours!"
 
 zaz_fixes.3.t: "Expansion of the Cossack Register"
 zaz_fixes.3.d: "The Polish Crown offers to expand the Cossack Register, granting official status and payment to more of our warriors. This would strengthen our military position and improve relations with the Commonwealth, but many Cossacks fear it compromises our independence. The unregistered Cossacks grow restless at this prospect."
 zaz_fixes.3.a: "Accept the expanded Register—we need Polish support."
 zaz_fixes.3.b: "We demand full autonomy, not bribes!"
 
 zaz_fixes.4.t: "Relocating the Sich"
 zaz_fixes.4.d: "War threatens the Sich! Enemy forces approach our sacred fortress. Our otamans propose relocating the Sich upstream to a more defensible position, following the tradition of our predecessors who moved the Sich multiple times throughout history. This would preserve our institutions but require abandoning our current fortifications."
 zaz_fixes.4.a: "Relocate the Sich to safety."
 zaz_fixes.4.b: "We will defend this ground to the last!"
 
 zaz_fixes.5.t: "Ottoman Retaliation for Raids"
 zaz_fixes.5.d: "Our unrestricted Chaiky raids have finally provoked the Sultan's wrath! Ottoman galleys sail up the Dnieper, bringing fire and destruction to our shores. We must either prepare our defenses and face the consequences of our raids, or sue for peace and moderate our aggressive activities."
 zaz_fixes.5.a: "Prepare for battle! We fear no Sultan!"
 zaz_fixes.5.b: "Send peace envoys—we've pushed too far."
 
 zaz_fixes.6.t: "The General Rada Convenes"
 zaz_fixes.6.d: "The General Rada, our sacred democratic assembly, gathers at the Sich. All Cossacks, from the lowliest to the most decorated otamans, have equal voice. Some argue we should strengthen these democratic traditions, preserving the unique Cossack way of governance. Others believe military necessity demands stronger otaman authority."
 zaz_fixes.6.a: "Democracy is our greatest strength!"
 zaz_fixes.6.b: "War demands strong military leadership."
