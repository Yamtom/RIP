 # Qasim Khanate Events
 qasim_khanate.1.t: "Foundation of the Qasim Khanate"
 qasim_khanate.1.d: "Following our recent conflicts with Kazan, Qasim, a prince of the Kazani royal house, has fled to our court seeking protection. He offers to establish a loyal Tatar khanate under our protection if we grant him lands and military support. This 'Qasim Khanate' could serve multiple purposes: a buffer against raids, a source of skilled cavalry, and most importantly, a rival claimant to the throne of Kazan that we can use to justify future interventions. However, hosting a rival khan may provoke Kazan's hostility."
 qasim_khanate.1.a: "Establish the Qasim Khanate as our vassal"
 qasim_khanate.1.b: "We need no puppet khanate"
 
 qasim_khanate.2.t: "The Qasim Khan's Ambition"
 qasim_khanate.2.d: "Our vassal, the Khan of Qasim, has petitioned for our support in pressing his claim to the throne of Kazan. As a prince of the Kazani royal house, he has legitimate grounds to challenge the current khan. Supporting his claim would give us a pretext for war and potentially place a loyal ruler on Kazan's throne. However, such aggression may alarm our neighbors and strain our resources."
 qasim_khanate.2.a: "Support the claim with military force"
 qasim_khanate.2.b: "Apply diplomatic pressure only"
 qasim_khanate.2.c: "Restrain our vassal for now"
 
 qasim_khanate.3.t: "The Fate of Conquered Kazan"
 qasim_khanate.3.d: "With Kazan conquered, we must decide its future. We could install our loyal Qasim vassal as Khan of Kazan, creating a large but dependent Tatar khanate under our control. This would please our Tatar subjects and provide a buffer state. Alternatively, we could annex Kazan directly, bringing its wealth and population under our direct administration but risking resentment from the Qasim Khan who expected to rule these lands."
 qasim_khanate.3.a: "Install the Qasim Khan as ruler of Kazan"
 qasim_khanate.3.b: "Annex Kazan directly into our realm"
 
 qasim_khanate.4.t: "The Future of the Qasim Khanate"
 qasim_khanate.4.d: "The Qasim Khanate has served faithfully as our vassal for many years. Its rulers have become thoroughly integrated into our court, their nobility intermarries with Russian families, and their military serves in our campaigns. The question arises whether to formally integrate this khanate into our realm or maintain it as a distinct but loyal vassal state. Integration would simplify administration but end a useful diplomatic fiction."
 qasim_khanate.4.a: "Integrate the khanate into our state"
 qasim_khanate.4.b: "Maintain them as a loyal vassal"
 
 qasim_khanate.5.t: "The Lipka Tatars Seek Settlement"
 qasim_khanate.5.d: "A group of Tatars, fleeing conflicts in the eastern steppes, have petitioned for permission to settle in our eastern territories. These 'Lipka Tatars' are Muslims who have already served various Christian rulers and are experienced in both warfare and administration. They offer to provide military service, particularly cavalry, in exchange for land grants and religious tolerance. Their settlement would strengthen our borders and provide elite cavalry, though it may concern our Orthodox subjects."
 qasim_khanate.5.a: "Grant them lands and welcome their service"
 qasim_khanate.5.b: "We need no Muslim settlers"
 
 qasim_khanate.6.t: "The Lipka Tatars' Loyalty"
 qasim_khanate.6.d: "The Lipka Tatars who settled in our lands have proven themselves loyal and capable warriors. Their cavalry has distinguished itself in numerous campaigns, and their nobility has integrated well into our social structure while maintaining their Muslim faith. They now seek formal recognition of their privileges and guarantees of religious freedom in exchange for continued military service. Granting these privileges would secure their loyalty for generations."
 qasim_khanate.6.a: "Grant formal privileges to the Lipka Tatars"
 qasim_khanate.6.b: "Maintain current informal arrangements"
