khmelnytsky_uprising_title:0 "Khmelnytsky Uprising"
khmelnytsky_uprising_desc:0 "The great Cossack rebellion against Polish-Lithuanian rule has erupted. Led by the hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, masses of Cossacks, peasants, and Tatars have risen in arms, devastating vast swathes of Ukrainian territory. Cities burn, entire communities are slaughtered, and the very foundations of Polish authority crumble before the insurgent tide."

# Event 1: Uprising Begins
khmelnytsky_events.1.t:0 "The Khmelnytsky Uprising"
khmelnytsky_events.1.d:0 "A charismatic Zaporozhian Cossack named Bohdan Khmelnytsky has called for the people of Ukraine to rise against Polish oppression. What began as a local Cossack rebellion has exploded into a massive popular uprising. Peasant serfs, townspeople, and entire Cossack regiments are rallying to his banner. Reports speak of destroyed estates, massacres of Polish magnates, and the flight of terrified refugees.\n\nThe hetman demands autonomy for Ukraine, respect for Cossack privileges, and an end to the oppression of the Orthodox Church. Whether we respond with force or negotiate, the very fabric of [Root.GetName]'s authority in the east is being torn apart."
khmelnytsky_events.1.a:0 "Allow the uprising to continue—we are unprepared for full-scale war."
khmelnytsky_events.1.b:0 "Mobilize our forces and crush this rebellion with military might!"

# Event 2: Uprising resolved
khmelnytsky_events.2.t:0 "The End of the Khmelnytsky Uprising"
khmelnytsky_events.2.d:0 "After years of savage warfare, disease, and devastation, the Khmelnytsky Uprising has finally ended. Whether through military suppression, negotiated settlement, or the exhaustion of both sides, peace has returned to Ukrainian lands—though a peace born of immense suffering.\n\nThe region lies in ruins. Entire generations have been lost, cities are depopulated, and the old order of Polish-Lithuanian dominance has been shattered. The map of Eastern Europe will never be quite the same."
khmelnytsky_events.2.a:0 "The nightmare is over... at last."

# Event 3: Raids intensify
khmelnytsky_events.3.t:0 "Cossack Raids Intensify"
khmelnytsky_events.3.d:0 "Reports arrive of intensified Cossack raids throughout the Ukrainian heartland. Armed bands of insurgents strike at supply lines, terrorize villages, and attack isolated garrisons. The rebellion continues to spread further south and east, pulling more and more regions into the chaos of war."
khmelnytsky_events.3.a:0 "The insurgents are too numerous and scattered to prevent all attacks."
khmelnytsky_events.3.b:0 "We must raise rebel armies to confront these brigands directly."

# Event 4: Massacres and atrocities
khmelnytsky_events.4.t:0 "Reports of Massacre and Atrocity"
khmelnytsky_events.4.d:0 "Horrifying reports arrive from the Ukrainian territories. Cossack insurgents and peasant mobs are systematically massacring Polish magnates, Catholic clergy, and Jewish communities. Entire towns are being put to the sword as revolutionary fervor sweeps through the populace. The brutality shocks even hardened soldiers.\n\nThis is not merely a rebellion—it has become a war of annihilation against Polish rule itself."
khmelnytsky_events.4.a:0 "This will only harden our resolve to crush them."

# Event 5: Peasant recruitment
khmelnytsky_events.5.t:0 "Peasants Flock to the Rebel Banner"
khmelnytsky_events.5.d:0 "An increasing flood of peasant conscripts is joining Khmelnytsky's forces, many fleeing manors where they face brutal serfdom. The rebel army grows not just in numbers but in legitimacy among the common folk, who see in Khmelnytsky a liberator from noble oppression.\n\nEvery village that converts to the rebellion costs us resources, manpower, and control."
khmelnytsky_events.5.a:0 "There is nothing we can do to stem this tide."
khmelnytsky_events.5.b:0 "We should offer the people concessions to restore loyalty."

# Event 6: Foreign intervention
khmelnytsky_events.6.t:0 "Moscow Offers Its Hand"
khmelnytsky_events.6.d:0 "Emissaries from Moscow have arrived, carrying proposals for alliance and mutual support. The Muscovite tsar saw an opportunity: the chaos in Ukraine could be turned to Moscow's advantage. By supporting the Cossack cause against Polish-Lithuanian rule, Moscow could extend its influence over Ukrainian lands.\n\nShould we accept Moscow's offer of protection, knowing that such acceptance may come with strings attached and long-term dependence on a foreign power?"
khmelnytsky_events.6.a:0 "We accept the Muscovite alliance."
khmelnytsky_events.6.b:0 "We must remain independent, whatever the cost."
