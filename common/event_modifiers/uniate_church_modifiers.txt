# UNIATE CHURCH MODIFIERS (Union of Brest 1596)
# =========================================================================
# HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
# The Union of Brest (1596) created the Greek Catholic (Uniate) Church,
# attempting to unite Orthodox and Catholic traditions under papal authority
# while preserving Eastern liturgy. This became a major religious-political
# force in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, creating tensions between:
# - Orthodox faithful (resisting Rome)
# - Catholic nobility (supporting union)
# - Greek Catholics (navigating both worlds)
#
# GAME MECHANICS:
# These modifiers represent different outcomes and stages of religious union:
# - Tolerance bonuses for successful integration
# - Conversion mechanics for spreading union
# - Unrest and autonomy penalties for resistance
# - Cultural and diplomatic effects of religious identity
