 podillia_disasters.1.t: "The Seeds of Discord"
 podillia_disasters.1.d: "Religious tensions have been simmering in $COUNTRY$ for years, but recent events have brought them to a boiling point. Orthodox clergy denounce Catholic influences from Poland, Catholic nobles view the Orthodox hierarchy with suspicion, and both groups increasingly persecute our Jewish communities. In Kamianets, riots broke out last week when a Catholic procession passed through the Jewish quarter. Unless we act decisively, this religious discord threatens to tear our realm apart."
 podillia_disasters.1.a: "We must find a path to peace."
 
 podillia_disasters.2.t: "Orthodox-Catholic Confrontation"
 podillia_disasters.2.d: "The Orthodox metropolitan and the Catholic bishop have entered into open conflict over ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Each claims authority over mixed congregations, and both have excommunicated clergy who recognize the other's authority. The nobility is divided along confessional lines, and several magnates have begun arming their retainers. This theological dispute risks becoming a civil war."
