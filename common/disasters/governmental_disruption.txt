# GOVERNMENTAL DISRUPTION DISASTER
# (XVIII–XIX ст.: 1750–1850 р.р. — модернізація vs. традиційні інститути)
# =========================================================================
#
# HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
# This disaster represents the tumultuous collision between Imperial Russian centralization
# (Peter I, Catherine II) and the surviving autonomy of Kyivan/Ruthenian regional principalities,
# the Hetmanate's charter rights, and local boyar/starshyna resistance to bureaucratic reform.
# The disaster triggers when a Kyivan or Ruthenian state attempts to implement European-style
# absolute monarchy reforms (creating new central ministries, standing armies, secular law codes)
# while facing resistance from traditionalist estates (Church, Nobility, Cossacks, Burghers).
#
# Historical Background:
# - Peter I's Reforms (1682–1725): Westernization program; creation of centralized ministries
#   (Colleges/Коллегии instead of boyar councils), secular state apparatus, standing military,
#   modern navy, etc. Encountered fierce resistance from traditionalists who saw reform as
#   apostasy (religious) and tyranny (political). Resulted in the Strelvetsy Rebellion (1682–1698),
#   peasant uprisings (Astrakhan Rebellion 1705), and cossack revolts (Bulavin Rebellion 1707–1708).
# - Catherine II's Reforms (1762–1796): Enlightened absolutism; reformed provincial administration,
#   judicial system, and noble rights; secularized church lands; created "free" peasant categories.
#   Met with stability in some quarters (nobility coopted through extended privileges) but sparked
#   Pugachev Rebellion (1773–1775) among cossacks and peasants who saw centralization as enserfment.
# - Hetmanate's Decline (1709–1764): After Mazepa's failed Swedish alliance (1708) and Russian
#   triumph at Poltava (1709), the Hetmanate's institutional autonomy was progressively stripped:
#   Hetmans were appointed directly by Russian governors rather than elected; autonomous regiments
#   (polky) were reorganized into centralized military units; the Rada's authority was curtailed;
#   Orthodox church lands began to be confiscated. By 1764, the hetmanate office itself was abolished
#   by Catherine II, and Kyivan/Chernihiv regions were incorporated into gubernial (provincial) system.
# - Kyivan Independence Attempts: Kyiv principality, under cultural and religious influence from
#   Mohyla Academy and Orthodox Church, occasionally resisted Russian centralization (e.g., support
#   for Mazepa in 1708), but lacked military and political power to succeed. By 1750s, Kyiv was
#   firmly subordinated to Russia, though local nobility and clergy preserved considerable de facto
#   autonomy in their estates.
# - Ruthenian Principality (Hypothetical in Mod): The mod appears to include a "Ruthenian" 
#   principality (KRU) which may represent a surviving autonomous entity in lands between Ukraine,
#   Muscovy, and Crimea (e.g., Pereyaslav, Zaporozhia, or a larger confederation). Such an entity
#   would face intense Russian pressure to centralize and submit; resistance from local cossacks,
#   clergy, and boyars would be intense.
#
# Key Reformers & Resisters:
# - Peter I: Architect of centralization; ruthlessly suppressed tradition; created an entirely new
#   military-bureaucratic elite (rank nobility, Table of Ranks, service obligations).
# - Catherine II: More subtle; coopted nobility with extended privileges and land grants; but
#   centralized provincial administration and reduced Church autonomy. Suppressed Pugachev Rebellion
#   and fortified absolute monarchy.
# - Kyivan Metropolitan and Orthodox Clergy: Resisted secularization and state control of church
#   lands and appointments; attempted to maintain ecclesiastical autonomy and defend Orthodox privileges.
# - Ruthenian/Cossack Starshyna: Resisted centralization as erosion of elective hetmanate system,
#   raiding autonomy, democratic Rada, and traditional land/military privileges. Some starshyna were
#   co-opted into Russian nobility (Table of Ranks); others rebelled.
# - Cossack Host (Sich, Registered Regiments): Viewed Peter/Catherine's reforms as enserfment;
#   opposed standing army integration, central taxation, and loss of Sich autonomy. Sparked multiple
#   rebellions (Bulavin 1707–1708, Zaporozhian unrest 1730s–1770s, Pugachev 1773–1775).
#
# Causes of Disruption:
# - Reform Momentum: New hetman or prince, ambitious reformer, or external pressure (from overlord
#   or from ambitious neighbors) triggers attempt at administrative modernization.
# - Estate Resistance: Clergy resists loss of church lands/autonomy; nobility resists centralization
#   of power and tribute demands; cossacks resist conscription and formalization of military hierarchy;
#   burghers resist increased taxation and regulation of trade.
# - Violence & Instability: Reformers attempt to enforce change through military force, new laws,
#   and bureaucratic authority. Traditionalists resist through defiance, capital flight, brigandage
#   (opryshky), and open rebellion. Civil war or intense unrest results.
# - Foreign Intervention: Russian overlord may demand faster centralization (increasing pressure on
#   local rulers), or Poland/Ottoman may offer support to traditionalists to destabilize Russian expansion.
#
# Crisis Mechanics in Historical Record:
# - Strelvetsy Rebellion (1682–1698): Peter I's own elite guards mutinied against reform; Peter
#   brutally suppressed them (public executions, monasteries for defeated rebels). Symbolized the
#   human cost of forced centralization.
# - Astrakhan Rebellion (1705–1706): Revolting against new taxation and conscription; suppressed
#   with bloody reprisal; thousands executed; thousands more fled to Crimea/Don regions.
# - Bulavin Rebellion (1707–1708): Cossack uprising on Don and Left Bank against Peter's centralization
#   and conscription. Bulavin, a Don Cossack leader, coordinated with Zaporozhian Sich and Mazepa's
#   defection to provide synchronized pressure. Rebellion suppressed only after Poltava; Bulavin was
#   killed by his own followers (pro-Russian moderate faction).
# - Pugachev Rebellion (1773–1775): Largest pre-modern peasant/cossack rebellion; claimed to be
#   Peter III (killed 1762) returning to reverse Catherine's reforms. Spread across Don, Volga,
#   Zaporozhia, involving cossacks, Calmyks, Bashkirs, serfs. Catherine brutally suppressed
#   (200,000+ killed) and strengthened state control even further (enserfed previously free peasants,
#   eliminated Zaporozhian Sich 1775).
#
# Game Design Notes:
# This disaster is designed for KIE (Kyiv) and KRU (Ruthenian Principality) and triggers when
# they are engaged in modernization reforms ("reactionary_response_flag" indicates a counter-reform
# or reform attempt). The disaster models the chaos of trying to centralize late-medieval institutions
# against entrenched estate opposition. It drains stability and increases war exhaustion (due to
# internal conflict). Modifiers depress legitimacy and increase unrest. The disaster can_end when
# stability reaches +2 and no rebel provinces remain—meaning the reformer has consolidated either
# through force (suppression of all resistance) or through negotiation (estates accept new order).
# Alternatively, can_stop if the ruler accepts autonomy (is_subject = yes; vassal to an overlord
# like Moscow, who co-opts the reformist agenda, taking pressure off local institutions).
#
# Mechanics: Disaster representing the turmoil when a Kyivan or Ruthenian state attempts
# European-style absolute monarchy reforms while facing resistance from estates (Church, Nobility,
# Cossacks, Burghers) wedded to medieval/autonomous traditions.
#
# Narrative: Simulates the catastrophic collision between Imperial Russian centralization 
# (Peter I, Catherine II) and surviving local autonomy, charter rights, and estate power.
# Attempts to implement new bureaucracies, standing armies, and centralized law faced fierce
# resistance; resulted in civil wars, rebellions, and ultimately forced subordination to 
# Russian state control (by 1790s, all Ukrainian/Ruthenian resistance had been quashed or coopted).
